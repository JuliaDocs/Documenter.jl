            "text": "Package Guide\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nDocumenter is a registered package and so can be installed via \nPkg.add\n.\n\n\nPkg\n.\nadd\n(\nDocumenter\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis package supports Julia \n0.4\n and \n0.5\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nDocumenter is designed to do one thing \u2013 combine markdown files and inline docstrings from Julia's docsystem into a single inter-linked document. What follows is a step-by-step guide to creating a simple document.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up the folder structure\n\n\nFirstly, we need a Julia module to document. This could be a package generated via \nPkgDev.generate\n or a single \n.jl\n script. For this guide we'll be using a package called \nExample.jl\n that has the following directory layout:\n\n\nExample/\n    src/\n        Example.jl\n    ...\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \n...\n just represent unimportant files and folders.\n\n\nWe must decide on a location where we'd like to store the documentation for this package. It's recommended to use a folder named \ndocs/\n in the toplevel of the package, like so\n\n\nExample/\n    docs/\n        ...\n    src/\n        Example.jl\n    ...\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the \ndocs/\n folder we need to add two things. A source folder which will contain the markdown files that will be used to build the finished document and a Julia script that will be used to control the build process. The following names are recommended\n\n\ndocs/\n    src/\n    make.jl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding an empty document\n\n\nWith our \ndocs/\n directory now setup we're going to build our first document. It'll just be a single empty file at the moment, but we'll be adding to it later on.\n\n\nAdd the following to your \nmake.jl\n file\n\n\nusing\n \nDocumenter\n,\n \nExample\n\n\n\nmakedocs\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assumes you've installed Documenter as discussed in \nInstallation\n and that your Examples package can be found by Julia.\n\n\nNow add an \nindex.md\n file to the \nsrc/\n directory. The name has no particular significance though and you may name it whatever you like. We'll stick to \nindex.md\n for this guide.\n\n\nLeave the newly added file empty and then run the following command from the \ndocs/\n directory\n\n\n$ julia make.jl\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \n$\n just represents the prompt character. You don't need to type that.\n\n\nIf you'd like to see the output from this command in color use\n\n\n$ julia --color\n=\nyes make.jl\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run that you should see the following output\n\n\nDocumenter\n:\n \nsetting\n \nup\n \nbuild\n \ndirectory\n.\n\n\nDocumenter\n:\n \nexpanding\n \nmarkdown\n \ntemplates\n.\n\n\nDocumenter\n:\n \nbuilding\n \ncross\n-\nreferences\n.\n\n\nDocumenter\n:\n \nrunning\n \ndocument\n \nchecks\n.\n\n\nDocumenter\n:\n \nrendering\n \ndocument\n.\n\n\nDocumenter\n:\n \npopulating\n \nindices\n.\n\n\nDocumenter\n:\n \ncopying\n \nassets\n \nto\n \nbuild\n \ndirectory\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ndocs/\n folder should contain a new directory \u2013 called \nbuild/\n. It's structure should look like the following\n\n\nbuild/\n    assets/\n        Documenter.css\n        mathjaxhelper.js\n    index.md\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment \nbuild/index.md\n should be empty since \nsrc/index.md\n is empty.\n\n\nAt this point you can add some text to \nsrc/index.md\n and rerun the \nmake.jl\n file to see the changes if you'd like to.\n\n\n\n\nAdding some docstrings\n\n\nNext we'll splice a docstring defined in the \nExample\n module into the \nindex.md\n file. To do this first document a function in that module:\n\n\nmodule\n \nExample\n\n\n\nexport\n \nfunc\n\n\n\n\n\n    func(x)\n\n\n\nReturns double the number `x` plus `1`.\n\n\n\n\nfunc\n(\nx\n)\n \n=\n \n2\nx\n \n+\n \n1\n\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen in the \nsrc/index.md\n file add the following\n\n\n# Example.jl Documentation\n\n```@docs\nfunc(x)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we next run \nmake.jl\n the docstring for \nExample.func(x)\n should appear in place of the \n@docs\n block in \nbuild/index.md\n. Note that \nmore than one\n object can be referenced inside a \n@docs\n block \u2013 just place each one on a separate line.\n\n\nNote that the module in which a \n@docs\n block is evaluated is determined by \ncurrent_module()\n and so will more than likely be \nMain\n. This means that each object listed in the block must be visible there. The module can be changed to something else on a per-page basis with a \n@meta\n block as in the following\n\n\n# Example.jl Documentation\n\n```@meta\nCurrentModule = Documenter\n```\n\n```@docs\nfunc(x)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Included Docstrings\n\n\nIn some cases you may want to include a docstring for a \nMethod\n that extends a \nFunction\n from a different module \u2013 such as \nBase\n. In the following example we extend \nBase.length\n with a new definition for type \nT\n and also add a docstring:\n\n\ntype\n T\n\n    \n# ...\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom `length` docs for `T`.\n\n\n\n\nBase\n.\nlength\n(::\nT\n)\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen trying to include this docstring with\n\n\n```@docs\nlength\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nall the docs for \nlength\n will be included \u2013 even those from other modules. There are two ways to solve this problem. Either include the type in the signature with\n\n\n```@docs\nlength(::T)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nor declare the specific modules that \nmakedocs\n should include with\n\n\nmakedocs\n(\n\n    \n# options\n\n    \nmodules\n \n=\n \n[\nMyModule\n]\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Referencing\n\n\nIt may be necessary to refer to a particular docstring or section of your document from elsewhere in the document. To do this we can make use of Documenter's cross-referencing syntax which looks pretty similar to normal markdown link syntax. Replace the contents of \nsrc/index.md\n with the following\n\n\n# Example.jl Documentation\n\n```@docs\nfunc(x)\n```\n\n- link to [Example.jl Documentation](@ref)\n- link to [`func(x)`](@ref)\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we just have to replace each link's url with \n@ref\n and write the name of the thing we'd link to cross-reference. For document headers it's just plain text that matches the name of the header and for docstrings enclose the object in backticks.\n\n\nThis also works across different pages in the same way. Note that these sections and docstrings must be unique within a document.\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\n\nDocumenter can auto-generate tables of contents and docstring indexes for your document with the following syntax. We'll illustrate these features using our \nindex.md\n file from the previous sections. Add the following to that file\n\n\n# Example.jl Documentation\n\n```@contents\n```\n\n## Functions\n\n```@docs\nfunc(x)\n```\n\n## Index\n\n```@index\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n@contents\n block will generate a nested list of links to all the section headers in the document. By default it will gather all the level 1 and 2 headers from every page in the document, but this can be adjusted using \nPages\n and \nDepth\n settings as in the following\n\n\n```@contents\nPages = [\nfoo.md\n, \nbar.md\n]\nDepth = 3\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n@index\n block will generate a flat list of links to all the docs that that have been spliced into the document using \n@docs\n blocks. As with the \n@contents\n block the pages to be included can be set with a \nPages = [...]\n line. Since the list is not nested \nDepth\n is not supported for \n@index\n.",

Hence \nOrder\n acts as a basic filter as well as sorter.\n\n\nIn addition to \nOrder\n, a \nPages\n vector may be included in \n@autodocs\n to filter docstrings based on the source file in which they are defined:\n\n\n```@\nautodocs\n\n\nModules\n \n=\n \n[\nFoo\n]\n\n\nPages\n   \n=\n \n[\na.jl\n,\n \nb.jl\n]\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example docstrings from module \nFoo\n found in source files that end in \na.jl\n and \nb.jl\n are included. The page order provided by \nPages\n is also used to sort the docstrings. Note that page matching is done using the end of the provided strings and so \na.jl\n will be matched by \nany\n source file that ends in \na.jl\n, i.e. \nsrc/a.jl\n or \nsrc/foo/a.jl\n.\n\n\nTo include only the exported names from the modules listed in \nModules\n use \nPrivate = false\n. In a similar way \nPublic = false\n can be used to only show the unexported names.

[Syntax](@ref) ...\n\n...

Text wrapped in backticks will cross-reference a docstring from a \n@docs\n block.\n\n\n@ref\ns may refer to docstrings or headers on different pages as well as the current page using the same syntax.\n\n\nNote that depending on what the \nCurrentModule\n is set to, a docstring \n@ref\n may need to be prefixed by the module which defines it.\n\n\nDuplicate Headers\n\n\nIn some cases a document may contain multiple headers with the same name, but on different pages or of different levels. To allow \n@ref\n to cross-reference a duplicate header it must be given a name as in the following example\n\n\n# [Header](@id my_custom_header_name)\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n## Header\n\n\n\n...\n \n[\nCustom\n \nHeader\n](@\nref\n \nmy_custom_header_name\n)\n \n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe link that wraps the named header is removed in the final document. The text for a named \n@ref ...\n does not need to match the header that it references. Named \n@ref ...\ns may refer to headers on different pages in the same way as unnamed ones do.\n\n\nDuplicate docstring references do not occur since splicing the same docstring into a document more than once is disallowed.\n\n\n\n\n@meta\n block\n\n\nThis block type is used to define metadata key/value pairs that can be used elsewhere in the page. Currently \nCurrentModule\n and \nDocTestSetup\n are the only recognised keys.\n\n\n```@meta\nCurrentModule = FooBar\nDocTestSetup  = quote\n    using MyPackage\nend\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \n@meta\n blocks are always evaluated with the \ncurrent_module()\n, which is typically \nMain\n.\n\n\nSee \nSetup Code\n section of the Doctests page for an explanation of \nDocTestSetup\n.\n\n\n\n\n@index\n block\n\n\nGenerates a list of links to docstrings that have been spliced into a document. Valid settings are \nPages\n, \nModules\n, and \nOrder\n. For example:\n\n\n```@\nindex\n\n\nPages\n   \n=\n \n[\nfoo.md\n]\n\n\nModules\n \n=\n \n[\nFoo\n,\n \nBar\n]\n\n\nOrder\n   \n=\n \n[\n:\nfunction\n,\n \n:\ntype\n]\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \nPages\n or \nModules\n are not provided then all pages or modules are included. \nOrder\n defaults to\n\n\n[:\nmodule\n,\n \n:\nconstant\n,\n \n:\ntype\n,\n \n:\nfunction\n,\n \n:\nmacro\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif not specified. \nOrder\n and \nModules\n behave the same way as in \n@autodocs\n block\ns and filter out docstrings that do not match one of the modules or categories specified.\n\n\nNote that the values assigned to \nPages\n, \nModules\n, and \nOrder\n may be any valid Julia code and thus can be something more complex that an array literal if required, i.e.\n\n\n```@index\nPages = map(file -\n joinpath(\nman\n, file), readdir(\nman\n))\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted though that in this case \nPages\n may not be sorted in the order that is expected by the user. Try to stick to array literals as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\n@contents\n block\n\n\nGenerates a nested list of links to document sections. Valid settings are \nPages\n and \nDepth\n.\n\n\n```@contents\nPages = [\nfoo.md\n]\nDepth = 5\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with \n@index\n if \nPages\n is not provided then all pages are included. The default \nDepth\n value is \n2\n.\n\n\n\n\n@example\n block\n\n\nEvaluates the code block and inserts the result into the final document along with the original source code.\n\n\n```@example\na = 1\nb = 2\na + b\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above \n@example\n block will splice the following into the final document\n\n\n```julia\na = 1\nb = 2\na + b\n```\n\n```\n3\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading and trailing newlines are removed from the rendered code blocks. Trailing whitespace on each line is also removed.\n\n\nHiding Source Code\n\n\nCode blocks may have some content that does not need to be displayed in the final document. \n# hide\n comments can be appended to lines that should not be rendered, i.e.\n\n\n```@example\nsrand(1) # hide\nA = rand(3, 3)\nb = [1, 2, 3]\nA \\ b\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that appending \n# hide\n to every line in an \n@example\n block will result in the block being hidden in the rendered document. The results block will still be rendered though.\n\n\nSTDOUT\n and \nSTDERR\n\n\nThe Julia output streams are redirected to the results block when evaluating \n@example\n blocks in the same way as when running doctest code blocks.\n\n\nnothing\n Results\n\n\nWhen the \n@example\n block evaluates to \nnothing\n then the second block is not displayed. Only the source code block will be shown in the rendered document. Note that if any output from either \nSTDOUT\n or \nSTDERR\n is captured then the results block will be displayed even if \nnothing\n is returned.\n\n\nNamed \n@example\n Blocks\n\n\nBy default \n@example\n blocks are run in their own anonymous \nModule\ns to avoid side-effects between blocks. To share the same module between different blocks on a page the \n@example\n can be named with the following syntax\n\n\n```@example 1\na = 1\n```\n\n```@example 1\nprintln(a)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name can be any text, not just integers as in the example above, i.e. \n@example foo\n.\n\n\nNamed \n@example\n blocks can be useful when generating documentation that requires intermediate explanation or multimedia such as plots as illustrated in the following example\n\n\nFirst we define some functions\n\n```@example 1\nusing PyPlot # hide\nf(x) = sin(2x) + 1\ng(x) = cos(x) - x\n```\n\nand then we plot `f` over the interval from ``-\u03c0`` to ``\u03c0``\n\n```@example 1\nx = linspace(-\u03c0, \u03c0)\nplot(x, f(x), color = \nred\n)\nsavefig(\nf-plot.svg\n); nothing # hide\n```\n\n![](f-plot.svg)\n\nand then we do the same with `g`\n\n```@example 1\nplot(x, g(x), color = \nblue\n)\nsavefig(\ng-plot.svg\n); nothing # hide\n```\n\n![](g-plot.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \n@example\n blocks are evaluated within the directory of \nbuild\n where the file will be rendered . This means than in the above example \nsavefig\n will output the \n.svg\n files into that directory. This allows the images to be easily referenced without needing to worry about relative paths.\n\n\n@example\n blocks automatically define \nans\n which, as in the Julia REPL, is bound to the value of the last evaluated expression. This can be useful in situations such as the following one where where binding the object returned by \nplot\n to a named variable would look out of place in the final rendered documentation:\n\n\n```@example\nusing Gadfly # hide\nplot([sin, x -\n 2sin(x) + x], -2\u03c0, 2\u03c0)\ndraw(SVG(\nplot.svg\n, 6inch, 4inch), ans); nothing # hide\n```\n\n![](plot.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@repl\n block\n\n\nThese are similar to \n@example\n blocks, but adds a \njulia\n prompt before each toplevel expression. \n;\n and \n# hide\n syntax may be used in \n@repl\n blocks in the same way as in the Julia REPL and \n@example\n blocks.\n\n\n```@repl\na = 1\nb = 2\na + b\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nwill generate\n\n\n```julia\njulia\n a = 1\n1\n\njulia\n b = 2\n2\n\njulia\n a + b\n3\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nNamed \n@repl \nname\n blocks behave in the same way as named \n@example \nname\n blocks.\n\n\n\n\n@eval\n block\n\n\nEvaluates the contents of the block and inserts the resulting value into the final document.\n\n\nIn the following example we use the PyPlot package to generate a plot and display it in the final document.\n\n\n```@eval\nusing PyPlot\n\nx = linspace(-\u03c0, \u03c0)\ny = sin(x)\n\nplot(x, y, color = \nred\n)\nsavefig(\nplot.svg\n)\n\nnothing\n```\n\n![](plot.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that each \n@eval\n block evaluates its contents within a separate module. When evaluating each block the present working directory, \npwd\n, is set to the directory in \nbuild\n where the file will be written to.\n\n\nAlso, instead of returning \nnothing\n in the example above we could have returned a new \nMarkdown.Image\n object directly. This can be more appropriate when the filename is not known until evaluation of the block itself.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn most cases \n@example\n is preferred over \n@eval\n. Just like in normal Julia code where \neval\n should be only be considered as a last resort, \n@eval\n should be treated in the same way.",

This allows the images to be easily referenced without needing to worry about relative paths.  @example  blocks automatically define  ans  which, as in the Julia REPL, is bound to the value of the last evaluated expression. This can be useful in situations such as the following one where where binding the object returned by  plot  to a named variable would look out of place in the final rendered documentation:  ```@example\nusing Gadfly # hide\nplot([sin, x -  2sin(x) + x], -2\u03c0, 2\u03c0)\ndraw(SVG( plot.svg , 6inch, 4inch), ans); nothing # hide\n```\n\n![](plot.svg)",

This can help to avoid documentation examples from becoming outdated, incorrect, or misleading. It's recommended that as many of a package's examples be runnable by Documenter's doctest.\n\n\nThis section of the manual outlines how to go about enabling doctests for code blocks in your package's documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\"Script\" Examples\n\n\nThe first, of two, types of doctests is the \"script\" code block. To make Documenter detect this kind of code block the following format must be used:\n\n\n```jldoctest\na = 1\nb = 2\na + b\n\n# output\n\n3\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code block's \"language\" must be \njldoctest\n and must include a line containing the text \n# output\n. The text before this line is the contents of the script which is run. The text that appears after \n# output\n is the textual representation that would be shown in the Julia REPL if the script had been \ninclude\nd.\n\n\nThe actual output produced by running the \"script\" is compared to the expected result and any difference will result in \nmakedocs\n throwing an error and terminating.\n\n\nNote that the amount of whitespace appearing above and below the \n# output\n line is not significant and can be increased or decreased if desired.\n\n\n\n\nREPL Examples\n\n\nThe other kind of doctest is a simulated Julia REPL session. The following format is detected by Documenter as a REPL doctest:\n\n\n```jldoctest\njulia\n a = 1\n1\n\njulia\n b = 2;\n\njulia\n c = 3;  # comment\n\njulia\n a + b + c\n6\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with script doctests, the code block must have it's language set to \njldoctest\n. When a code block contains one or more \njulia\n at the start of a line then it is assumed to be a REPL doctest. Semi-colons, \n;\n, at the end of a line works in the same way as in the Julia REPL and will suppress the output, although the line is still evaluated.\n\n\nNote that not all features of the REPL are supported such as shell and help modes.\n\n\n\n\nExceptions\n\n\nDoctests can also test for thrown exceptions and their stacktraces. Comparing of the actual and expected results is done by checking whether the expected result matches the start of the actual result. Hence, both of the following errors will match the actual result.\n\n\n```jldoctest\njulia\n div(1, 0)\nERROR: DivideError: integer division error\n in div(::Int64, ::Int64) at ./int.jl:115\n\njulia\n div(1, 0)\nERROR: DivideError: integer division error\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nIf instead the first \ndiv(1, 0)\n error was written as\n\n\n```jldoctest\njulia\n div(1, 0)\nERROR: DivideError: integer division error\n in div(::Int64, ::Int64) at ./int.jl:114\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere line \n115\n is replaced with \n114\n then the doctest will fail.\n\n\nIn the second \ndiv(1, 0)\n, where no stacktrace is shown, it may appear to the reader that it is expected that no stacktrace will actually be displayed when they attempt to try to recreate the error themselves. To indicate to readers that the output result is truncated and does not display the entire (or any of) the stacktrace you may write \n[...]\n at the line where checking should stop, i.e.\n\n\n```jldoctest\njulia\n div(1, 0)\nERROR: DivideError: integer division error\n[...]\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkipping Doctests\n\n\nDoctesting can be disabled by setting the \nmakedocs\n keyword \ndoctest = false\n. This should only be done when initially laying out the structure of a package's documentation, after which it's encouraged to always run doctests when building docs.\n\n\n\n\nSetup Code\n\n\nDoctests may require some setup code that must be evaluated prior to that of the actual example, but that should not be displayed in the final documentation. It could also be that several separate doctests require the same definitions. For both of these cases a \n@meta\n block containing a \nDocTestSetup = ...\n value can be used as follows:\n\n\n```\njldoctest\n\n\njulia\n \nusing\n \nDataFrames\n\n\n\njulia\n \ndf\n \n=\n \nDataFrame\n(\nA\n \n=\n \n1\n:10\n,\n \nB\n \n=\n \n2\n:2:20\n);\n\n\n\n```\n\n\n\nSome\n \ntext\n \ndiscussing\n \n`\ndf\n`\n...\n\n\n\n```\n@meta\n\n\nDocTestSetup\n \n=\n \nquote\n\n    \nusing\n \nDataFrames\n\n    \ndf\n \n=\n \nDataFrame\n(\nA\n \n=\n \n1\n:10\n,\n \nB\n \n=\n \n2\n:2:20\n)\n\n\nend\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n```\njldoctest\n\n\njulia\n \ndf\n[\n1\n,\n \n1\n]\n\n\n1\n\n\n```\n\n\n\nSome\n \nmore\n \ntext\n...\n\n\n\n```\njldoctest\n\n\njulia\n \ndf\n[\n1\n,\n \n:\n]\n\n\n1x2\n \nDataFrames\n.DataFrame\n\n\n|\n \nRow\n \n|\n \nA\n \n|\n \nB\n \n|\n\n\n|\n-----\n|\n---\n|\n---\n|\n\n\n|\n \n1\n   \n|\n \n1\n \n|\n \n2\n \n|\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n```\n@meta\n\n\nDocTestSetup\n \n=\n \nnothing\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \nDocTestSetup\n value is \nre-evaluated\n at the start of \neach\n doctest block and no state is shared between any code blocks.

This guide will describe how to setup automatic updates for your package docs using the Travis build service and GitHub Pages. This is the same approach used by this package to host it's own docs \u2013 the docs you're currently reading.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFollowing this guide should be the \nfinal\n step you take after you are comfortable with the syntax and build process used by \nDocumenter.jl\n. Only proceed with the steps outlined on this page once you have successfully used \nmkdocs\n locally to build your documentation.  \nmkdocs\n can typically be installed using \npip install mkdocs\n in your terminal.\n\n\nThis guide assumes that you already have GitHub and Travis accounts setup. If not then go set those up first and then return here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOnce setup correctly the following will happen each time you push new updates to your package repository:\n\n\n\n\ntravis buildbots startup and run your tests;\n\n\neach buildbot will build the package docs using your \ndocs/make.jl\n script;\n\n\na single buildbot will then try to push the generated docs back to github.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the hosted documentation does not update when you make pull requests; you see updates only when you merge to \nmaster\n or push new tags.\n\n\nThe following sections outline how to enable this for your own package.\n\n\n\n\nDeploy Keys\n\n\nTwo methods are available for securely deploying generated documentation from Travis to GitHub. The first method listed below is the preferred approach. The second, and original, method should be avoided whenever possible.\n\n\n\n\nSSH Deploy Keys\n\n\nDeploy keys provide push access to a \nsingle\n repository.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou will need several command line programs installed for the following steps to work. They are \nwhich\n, \ngit\n, \nssh-keygen\n, and \ntravis\n.  Make sure these are installed before you begin.\n\n\n\n\nOpen a Julia REPL and import \nDocumenter\n.\n\n\njulia\n \nusing\n \nDocumenter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen call the \nTravis.genkeys\n function as follows:\n\n\njulia\n \nTravis\n.\ngenkeys\n(\nMyPackage\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\"MyPackage\"\n is the name of the package you would like to create deploy keys for.\n\n\nYou may be asked to enter your password for Travis during this process. Once complete you will need to add the public key displayed in the REPL to your repository \u2013 just follow the instructions displayed in the REPL. If you see a line about adding an \nopenssl\n command to your \n.travis.yml\n file, you can ignore that (Documenter will handle that for you).\n\n\nThen close the REPL and commit the \ndocs/.documenter.enc\n file that was generated by \nTravis.genkeys\n to the repository. You can skip the \nGitHub Security Tokens\n section and move straight on to \nTravis Environment Settings\n now.\n\n\nIf you don't get a \ndocs/.documenter.enc\n file, one possible reason is an outdated version of \ntravis\n. At the time of this writing, version 1.8.2 was known to work.\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Security Tokens\n\n\nThese tokens provide push access to \nevery\n repository owned by the user.\n\n\nFirstly, generate a new \npersonal access token\n.\n\n\nEnter a description for this new token. We'll be calling ours \"Travis\", but any other name will do. For the \"Select scopes\" option choose \"public_repo\" \nonly\n. Then generate the token and save it somewhere safe. We'll be needing it during the next section.\n\n\n\n\nTravis Environment Settings\n\n\n\n\nSSH Keys\n\n\nIf you used \nTravis.genkeys\n in the previous step then you should go to your Travis settings page and check that two new keys have been added with names similar to the following\n\n\n\n\nencrypted_e6b49e69746a_key\n\n\nencrypted_e6b49e69746a_iv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTokens\n\n\nIf you generated a GitHub token during the previous step then we'll add the token to our repository's Travis page. Go to the settings page for the repository and under the \"Environment Variables\" section add a new variable called \nGITHUB_API_KEY\n. Copy the generated key from the \nGitHub Security Tokens\n section as the value and \nmake sure\n that \"Display value in build log\" is \noff\n. Be careful to remove any leading white-space from the key. Then add the key.\n\n\n\n\n.travis.yml\n Configuration\n\n\nIn the \nafter_success\n section of the \n.travis.yml\n file, where code coverage is processed, run your \ndocs/make.jl\n file:\n\n\nafter_success\n:\n\n  \n-\n \njulia -e \nPkg.add(\nDocumenter\n)\n\n  \n-\n \njulia -e \ncd(Pkg.dir(\nPACKAGE_NAME\n)); include(joinpath(\ndocs\n, \nmake.jl\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ndeploydocs\n Function\n\n\nAt the moment your \ndocs/make.jl\n file probably only contains\n\n\nusing\n \nDocumenter\n,\n \nPACKAGE_NAME\n\n\n\nmakedocs\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll need to add an additional call to this file after \nmakedocs\n. Add the following at the end of the file:\n\n\ndeploydocs\n(\n\n    \nrepo\n \n=\n \ngithub.com/USER_NAME/PACKAGE_NAME.jl.git\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nUSER_NAME\n and \nPACKAGE_NAME\n must be set to the appropriate names.\n\n\nBy default \ndeploydocs\n will deploy the documentation from the \nnightly\n Julia build for Linux. This can be changed using the \njulia\n and \nosname\n keywords as follows:\n\n\ndeploydocs\n(\n\n    \ndeps\n   \n=\n \nDeps\n.\npip\n(\nmkdocs\n,\n \npython-markdown-math\n),\n\n    \nrepo\n   \n=\n \ngithub.com/USER_NAME/PACKAGE_NAME.jl.git\n,\n\n    \njulia\n  \n=\n \n0.4\n,\n\n    \nosname\n \n=\n \nosx\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will deploy the docs from the OSX Julia 0.4 Travis build bot.\n\n\nThe keyword \ndeps\n serves to provide the required dependencies to deploy the documentation. In the example above we include the dependencies \nmkdocs\n and \npython-markdown-math\n. The former makes sure that MkDocs is installed to deploy the documentation, and the latter provides the \nmdx_math\n markdown extension to exploit MathJax rendering of latex equations in markdown. Other dependencies should be included here.\n\n\nSee the \ndeploydocs\n function documentation for more details.\n\n\n\n\nThe MkDocs \nmkdocs.yml\n File\n\n\nWe'll be using \nMkDocs\n to convert the markdown files generated by Documenter to HTML. (This, of course, is not the only option you have for this step. Any markdown to HTML converter should work fine with some amount of setting up.)\n\n\nAdd an \nmkdocs.yml\n file to your \ndocs/\n directory with the following content:\n\n\nsite_name\n:\n        \nPACKAGE_NAME.jl\n\n\nrepo_url\n:\n         \nhttps://github.com/USER_NAME/PACKAGE_NAME.jl\n\n\nsite_description\n:\n \nDescription...\n\n\nsite_author\n:\n      \nUSER_NAME\n\n\n\ntheme\n:\n \nreadthedocs\n\n\n\nextra_css\n:\n\n  \n-\n \nassets/Documenter.css\n\n\n\nextra_javascript\n:\n\n  \n-\n \nhttps://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML\n\n  \n-\n \nassets/mathjaxhelper.js\n\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n:\n\n  \n-\n \nextra\n\n  \n-\n \ntables\n\n  \n-\n \nfenced_code\n\n  \n-\n \nmdx_math\n\n\n\ndocs_dir\n:\n \nbuild\n\n\n\npages\n:\n\n  \n-\n \nHome\n:\n \nindex.md\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is only a basic skeleton. Read through the MkDocs documentation if you would like to know more about the available settings.\n\n\n\n\n.gitignore\n\n\nAdd the following to your package's \n.gitignore\n file\n\n\ndocs/build/\ndocs/site/\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are needed to avoid committing generated content to your repository.\n\n\n\n\ngh-pages\n Branch\n\n\nCreate a new branch called \ngh-pages\n and push it to GitHub. If this branch already exists then you can skip this step, but do note that the generated content is automatically pushed to this branch from Travis.\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation Versions\n\n\nWhen documentation is generated it is stored in one of the following folders:\n\n\n\n\nlatest\n stores the most recent documentation that is committed to the \nmaster\n branch.\n\n\nstable\n stores the most recent documentation from a tagged commit. Older tagged versions are stored in directories named after their tags. These tagged directories are persistent and must be manually removed from the \ngh-pages\n branch if necessary.\n\n\n\n\nOnce your documentation has been pushed to the \ngh-pages\n branch you should add links to your \nREADME.md\n pointing to the \nstable\n and \nlatest\n documentation URLs. It is common practice to make use of \"badges\" similar to those used for Travis and AppVeyor build statuses or code coverage. Adding the following to your package \nREADME.md\n should be all that is necessary:\n\n\n[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-stable-blue.svg)](https://USER_NAME.github.io/PACKAGE_NAME.jl/stable)\n[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-blue.svg)](https://USER_NAME.github.io/PACKAGE_NAME.jl/latest)\n\n\n\n\n\nPACKAGE_NAME\n and \nUSER_NAME\n should be replaced with their appropriate values. The colour and text of the image can be changed by altering \ndocs-stable-blue\n as described on \nshields.io\n, though it is recommended that package authors follow this standard to make it easier for potential users to find documentation links across multiple package README files.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Remarks\n\n\nThat should be all that is needed to enable automatic documentation building. Pushing new commits to your \nmaster\n branch should trigger doc builds. \nNote that other branches do not trigger these builds and neither do pull requests by potential contributors.\n\n\nIf you would like to see a more complete example of how this process is setup then take a look at this package's repository for some inspiration.",

The name of the build directory is, by convention, called \nbuild\n, though, like with \nsource\n, users are free to change this to anything else to better suit their project needs.\n\n\nclean\n tells \nmakedocs\n whether to remove all the content from the \nbuild\n folder prior to generating new content from \nsource\n. By default this is set to \ntrue\n.\n\n\ndoctest\n instructs \nmakedocs\n on whether to try to test Julia code blocks that are encountered in the generated document. By default this keyword is set to \ntrue\n. Doctesting should only ever be disabled when initially setting up a newly developed package where the developer is just trying to get their package and documentation structure correct. After that, it's encouraged to always make sure that documentation examples are runnable and produce the expected results. See the \nDoctests\n manual section for details about running doctests.\n\n\nmodules\n specifies a vector of modules that should be documented in \nsource\n. If any inline docstrings from those modules are seen to be missing from the generated content then a warning will be printed during execution of \nmakedocs\n. By default no modules are passed to \nmodules\n and so no warnings will appear. This setting can be used as an indicator of the \"coverage\" of the generated documentation. For example Documenter's \nmake.jl\n file contains:\n\n\nusing\n \nDocumenter\n\n\n\nmakedocs\n(\n\n    \nmodules\n \n=\n \nDocumenter\n,\n\n    \nclean\n   \n=\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n)\n\n\n\ndeploydocs\n(\n\n    \ndeps\n \n=\n \nDeps\n.\npip\n(\npygments\n,\n \nmkdocs\n,\n \nmkdocs-material\n,\n \npython-markdown-math\n),\n\n    \nrepo\n \n=\n \ngithub.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl.git\n,\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand so any docstring from the module \nDocumenter\n that is not spliced into the generated documentation in \nbuild\n will raise a warning.\n\n\nrepo\n specifies a template for the \"link to source\" feature. If you are using GitHub, this is automatically generated from the remote. If you are using a different host, you can use this option to tell Documenter how URLs should be generated. The following placeholders will be replaced with the respective value of the generated link:\n\n\n\n\n{commit}\n Git commit id\n\n\n{path}\n Path to the file in the repository\n\n\n{line}\n Line (or range of lines) in the source file\n\n\n\n\nFor example if you are using GitLab.com, you could use\n\n\nmakedocs\n(\nrepo\n \n=\n \nhttps://gitlab.com/user/project/blob/{commit}{path}#L{line}\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\nA guide detailing how to document a package using Documenter's \nmakedocs\n is provided in the \nUsage\n section of the manual.\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nDocumenter.deploydocs\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\ndeploydocs(\n    root   = \ncurrent-directory\n,\n    target = \nsite\n,\n    repo   = \nrequired\n,\n    branch = \ngh-pages\n,\n    latest = \nmaster\n,\n    osname = \nlinux\n,\n    julia  = \nnightly\n,\n    deps   = \nFunction\n,\n    make   = \nFunction\n,\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nConverts markdown files generated by \nmakedocs\n to HTML and pushes them to \nrepo\n.

Deploys generated documentation from  Travis-CI  to  GitHub Pages .   Additionally it provides the unexported  Documenter.generate , which can be used to generate documentation stubs for new packages.  source  #  Documenter.makedocs     Function .  makedocs(\n    root    =  current-directory ,\n    source  =  src ,\n    build   =  build ,\n    clean   = true,\n    doctest = true,\n    modules = Module[],\n    repo    =  ,\n)  Combines markdown files and inline docstrings into an interlinked document. In most cases  makedocs  should be run from a  make.jl  file:  using   Documenter  makedocs ( \n     # keywords...  )   which is then run from the command line with:  $ julia make.jl  The folder structure that  makedocs  expects looks like:  docs/\n    build/\n    src/\n    make.jl  Keywords  root  is the directory from which  makedocs  should run. When run from a  make.jl  file this keyword does not need to be set. It is, for the most part, needed when repeatedly running  makedocs  from the Julia REPL like so:  julia  makedocs(root = Pkg.dir( MyPackage ,  docs ))  source  is the directory, relative to  root , where the markdown source files are read from. By convention this folder is called  src . Note that any non-markdown files stored in  source  are copied over to the build directory when  makedocs  is run.  build  is the directory, relative to  root , into which generated files and folders are written when  makedocs  is run. The name of the build directory is, by convention, called  build , though, like with  source , users are free to change this to anything else to better suit their project needs.  clean  tells  makedocs  whether to remove all the content from the  build  folder prior to generating new content from  source . By default this is set to  true .  doctest  instructs  makedocs  on whether to try to test Julia code blocks that are encountered in the generated document. By default this keyword is set to  true .

This means that passing two vectors of nodes to a \ndiv\n will result in a \ndiv\n node with a single vector of children (the concatenation of the two vectors) rather than two vector children. The only arguments that are not flattened are nested nodes.\n\n\nString arguments are automatically converted into text nodes. Text nodes do not have any children or attributes and when displayed the string is escaped using \nescapehtml\n.\n\n\nAttributes\n\n\nAs well as plain nodes shown in the previous example, nodes can have attributes added to them using the following syntax.\n\n\ndiv\n[\n.my-class\n](\n\n    \nimg\n[:\nsrc\n \n=\n \nfoo.jpg\n],\n\n    \ninput\n[\n#my-id\n,\n \n:\ndisabled\n]\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example we add a \nclass = \"my-class\"\n attribute to the \ndiv\n node, a \nsrc = \"foo.jpg\"\n to the \nimg\n, and \nid = \"my-id\" disabled\n attributes to the \ninput\n node.\n\n\nThe following syntax is supported within \n[...]\n:\n\n\ntag\n[\n#id\n]\n\n\ntag\n[\n.class\n]\n\n\ntag\n[\n.class#id\n]\n\n\ntag\n[:\ndisabled\n]\n\n\ntag\n[:\nsrc\n \n=\n \nfoo.jpg\n]\n\n\n# ... or any combination of the above arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Representation\n\n\nThe \n@tags\n macro defines named \nTag\n objects as follows\n\n\n@\ntags\n \ndiv\n \np\n \nem\n \nstrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpands to\n\n\nconst\n \ndiv\n,\n \np\n,\n \nem\n,\n \nstrong\n \n=\n \nTag\n(:\ndiv\n),\n \nTag\n(:\np\n),\n \nTag\n(:\nem\n),\n \nTag\n(:\nstrong\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \nTag\n objects are lightweight representations of empty HTML elements without any attributes and cannot be used to represent a complete document.

            "text": "#  Documenter.Utilities.DOM     Module .  Provides a domain specific language for representing HTML documents.  Examples  using   Documenter . Utilities . DOM  # `DOM` does not export any HTML tags. Define the ones we actually need.  @ tags   div   p   em   strong   ul   li  div ( \n     p ( This  ,   em ( is ),    a  ,   strong ( paragraph. ), \n     p ( And this is  ,   strong ( another ),    one ), \n     ul ( \n         li ( and ), \n         li ( an ), \n         li ( unordered ), \n         li ( list ) \n     )  )   Notes  All the arguments passed to a node are flattened into a single vector rather than preserving any nested structure. This means that passing two vectors of nodes to a  div  will result in a  div  node with a single vector of children (the concatenation of the two vectors) rather than two vector children. The only arguments that are not flattened are nested nodes.  String arguments are automatically converted into text nodes. Text nodes do not have any children or attributes and when displayed the string is escaped using  escapehtml .  Attributes  As well as plain nodes shown in the previous example, nodes can have attributes added to them using the following syntax.  div [ .my-class ]( \n     img [: src   =   foo.jpg ], \n     input [ #my-id ,   : disabled ]  )   In the above example we add a  class = \"my-class\"  attribute to the  div  node, a  src = \"foo.jpg\"  to the  img , and  id = \"my-id\" disabled  attributes to the  input  node.  The following syntax is supported within  [...] :  tag [ #id ]  tag [ .class ]  tag [ .class#id ]  tag [: disabled ]  tag [: src   =   foo.jpg ]  # ... or any combination of the above arguments.   Internal Representation  The  @tags  macro defines named  Tag  objects as follows  @ tags   div   p   em   strong   expands to  const   div ,   p ,   em ,   strong   =   Tag (: div ),   Tag (: p ),   Tag (: em ),   Tag (: strong )   These  Tag  objects are lightweight representations of empty HTML elements without any attributes and cannot be used to represent a complete document. To create an actual tree of HTML elements that can be rendered we need to add some attributes and/or child elements using  getindex  or  call  syntax. Applying either to a  Tag  object will construct a new  Node  object.  tag ( ... )        # No attributes.  tag [ ... ]        # No children.  tag [ ... ]( ... )   # Has both attributes and children.   All three of the above syntaxes return a new  Node  object. Printing of  Node  objects is defined using the standard Julia display functions, so only needs a call to  print  to print out a valid HTML document with all nessesary text escaped.  source  #  Documenter.Utilities.DOM.@tags     Macro .  Define a collection of  Tag  objects and bind them to constants with the same names.  Examples  Defined globally within a module:  @ tags   div   ul   li   Defined within the scope of a function to avoid cluttering the global namespace:  function  template ( args ... ) \n     @ tags   div   ul   li \n     # ...  end   source  #  Documenter.Utilities.DOM.Node     Type .

The  Selectors  module provides an extensible way to write code that has to dispatch on different predicates without hardcoding the control flow into a single chain of  if  statements.  In the following example a selector for a simple condition is implemented and the generated selector code is described:  abstract  MySelector   :   Selectors . AbstractSelector  # The different cases we want to test.  abstract  One      :   MySelector  abstract  NotOne   :   MySelector  # The order in which to test the cases.  Selectors . order (:: Type { One })      =   0.0  Selectors . order (:: Type { NotOne })   =   1.0  # The predicate to test against.  Selectors . matcher (:: Type { One },   x )      =   x   ===   1  Selectors . matcher (:: Type { NotOne },   x )   =   x   !==   1  # What to do when a test is successful.  Selectors . runner (:: Type { One },   x )      =   println ( found one )  Selectors . runner (:: Type { NotOne },   x )   =   println ( not found )  # Test our selector with some numbers.  for   i   in   0 : 5 \n     Selectors . dispatch ( MySelector ,   i )  end   The code generated by  Selectors.dispatch(Selector, i)  will look similar to the following:  function  dispatch (:: Type { MySelector },   i :: Int ) \n     if   matcher ( One ,   i ) \n         runner ( One ,   i ) \n     elseif   matcher ( NotOne ,   i ) \n         runner ( NotOne ,   i ) \n     end  end   which would be further simplified after inlining  matcher  and  runner  as  function  dispatch (:: Type { MySelector },   i :: Int ) \n     if   i   ===   1 \n         println ( found one ) \n     elseif   i   !==   1 \n         println ( not found ) \n     end  end   The module provides the following interface for creating selectors:   order  matcher  runner  strict  disable  dispatch   source  #  Documenter.Selectors.AbstractSelector     Type .  Root selector type. Each user-defined selector must subtype from this, i.e.  abstract  MySelector   :   Selectors . AbstractSelector  abstract  First    :   MySelector  abstract  Second   :   MySelector   source  #  Documenter.Selectors.disable     Method .  Disable a particular case in a selector so that it is never used.  Selectors . disable (:: Type { Debug })   =   true   source  #  Documenter.Selectors.dispatch     Method .  Generated function that builds a specialised selector for each selector type provided, i.e.  Selectors . dispatch ( MySelector ,   1 )   source  #  Documenter.Selectors.matcher     Function .  Define the matching test for each case in a selector, i.e.  Selectors . matcher (:: Type { First },   x )    =   x   ==   1  Selectors . matcher (:: Type { Second },   x )   =   true   Note that the return type must be  Bool .  To match against multiple cases use the  Selectors.strict  function.  source  #  Documenter.Selectors.order     Function .  Define the precedence of each case in a selector, i.e.  Selectors . order (:: Type { First })    =   1.0  Selectors . order (:: Type { Second })   =   2.0   Note that the return type must be  Float64 . Defining multiple case types to have the same order will result in undefined behaviour.  source  #  Documenter.Selectors.runner     Function .  Define the code that will run when a particular  Selectors.matcher  test returns  true , i.e.  Selectors . runner (:: Type { First },   x )    =   println ( `x` is equal to `1`. )  Selectors . runner (:: Type { Second },   x )   =   println ( `x` is not equal to `1`. )   source  #  Documenter.Selectors.strict     Method .  Define whether a selector case will \"fallthrough\" or not when successfully matched against. By default matching is strict and does not fallthrough to subsequent selector cases.  # Adding a debugging selector case.  abstract  Debug   :   MySelector  # Insert prior to all other cases.  Selectors . order (:: Type { Debug })   =   0.0  # Fallthrough to the next case on success.  Selectors . strict (:: Type { Debug })   =   false  # We always match, regardless of the value of `x`.  Selectors . matcher (:: Type { Debug },   x )   =   true  # Print some debugging info.  Selectors . runner (:: Type { Debug },   x )   =   @ show   x   source",
