# Examples

Sometimes the best way to learn how to use a new package is to look for
examples of what others have already built with it.

The following packages use Documenter to build their documentation and so
should give a good overview of what this package is currently able to do.

**Note**

Packages are listed alphabetically. If you have a package that uses Documenter
then please open a PR that adds it to the appropriate list below.

The `make.jl` file for all listed packages will be tested to check for potential
regressions prior to tagging new Documenter releases whenever possible.
