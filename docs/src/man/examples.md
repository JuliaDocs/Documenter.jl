# Examples

Sometimes the best way to learn how to use a new package is to look for
examples of what others have already built with it.

Nowadays most of Julia packages use Documenter.jl to build their documentation.
The following sites are based on Documenter.jl and so should give a good overview of what this package is currently able to do.
Please open a PR if the following description is not up-to-date.

- [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)
  - The Julia official documentation.
- [Documenter.jl](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/dev/)
  - The documentation of Documenter.jl is built with Documenter.jl of course.
  - The source of the docs might be complicated for beginngers, but still a good reference.
- [DrWatson.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/dev/)
  - DrWatson.jl has nice CSS customization which can be good reference.
- [GeophysicalFlows.jl](https://fourierflows.github.io/GeophysicalFlowsDocumentation/dev/)
- [Luxor.jl](https://juliagraphics.github.io/Luxor.jl/dev/)
  - Luxor is a Julia package for drawing simple static 2D vector graphics.
  - It has nice tutorials and examples.
- [Oceananigans.jl](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/dev/)
  - The figures in the documentation is generated with [CairoMakie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl) during the document generation.
- [FourierFlows.jl](https://fourierflows.github.io/FourierFlowsDocumentation/dev/)
  - The figures in the documentation is generated with [CairoMakie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl) during the document generation.
- [POMDPs.jl](https://juliapomdp.github.io/POMDPs.jl/dev/)
- [PhyloNetworks.jl](https://crsl4.github.io/PhyloNetworks.jl/dev/)

Some projects or organizations maintain dedicated documentation repositories that are
separate from specific packages.

- [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/)
  - This site is built with [MultiDocumenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/MultiDocumenter.jl).
- [JuliaDocs landing page](https://juliadocs.org/)
- [JuliaImages](https://juliaimages.org/dev/)
  - The site is a good example with [DemoCards.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/DemoCards.jl)
- [JuliaMusic](https://juliamusic.github.io/JuliaMusic_documentation.jl/dev/)
  - JuliaMusic site has nice CSS customization which can be good reference.
- [Plots.jl](https://docs.juliaplots.org/dev/)
  - The documentation for Plots.jl.
