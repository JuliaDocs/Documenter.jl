Define the ones we actually need.\n@tags div p em strong ul li\n\ndiv(\n    p(\"This \", em(\"is\"), \" a \", strong(\"paragraph.\"),\n    p(\"And this is \", strong(\"another\"), \" one\"),\n    ul(\n        li(\"and\"),\n        li(\"an\"),\n        li(\"unordered\"),\n        li(\"list\")\n    )\n)\n\nNotes\n\nAll the arguments passed to a node are flattened into a single vector rather than preserving any nested structure. This means that passing two vectors of nodes to a div will result in a div node with a single vector of children (the concatenation of the two vectors) rather than two vector children. The only arguments that are not flattened are nested nodes.\n\nString arguments are automatically converted into text nodes. Text nodes do not have any children or attributes and when displayed the string is escaped using escapehtml.\n\nAttributes\n\nAs well as plain nodes shown in the previous example, nodes can have attributes added to them using the following syntax.\n\ndiv[\".my-class\"](\n    img[:src => \"foo.jpg\"],\n    input[\"#my-id\", :disabled]\n)\n\nIn the above example we add a class = \"my-class\" attribute to the div node, a src = \"foo.jpg\" to the img, and id = \"my-id\" disabled attributes to the input node.\n\nThe following syntax is supported within [...]:\n\ntag[\"#id\"]\ntag[\".class\"]\ntag[\".class#id\"]\ntag[:disabled]\ntag[:src => \"foo.jpg\"]\n# ... or any combination of the above arguments.\n\nInternal Representation\n\nThe @tags macro defines named Tag objects as follows\n\n@tags div p em strong\n\nexpands to\n\nconst div, p, em, strong = Tag(:div), Tag(:p), Tag(:em), Tag(:strong)\n\nThese Tag objects are lightweight representations of empty HTML elements without any attributes and cannot be used to represent a complete document. To create an actual tree of HTML elements that can be rendered we need to add some attributes and/or child elements using getindex or call syntax. Applying either to a Tag object will construct a new Node object.\n\ntag(...)      # No attributes.\ntag[...]      # No children.\ntag[...](...) # Has both attributes and children.\n\nAll three of the above syntaxes return a new Node object. Printing of Node objects is defined using the standard Julia display functions, so only needs a call to print to print out a valid HTML document with all necessary text escaped.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.DOM.HTMLDocument","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.DOM.HTMLDocument","text":"A HTML node that wraps around the root node of the document and adds a DOCTYPE to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.DOM.Node","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.DOM.Node","text":"Represents an element within an HTML document including any textual content, children Nodes, and attributes.\n\nThis type should not be constructed directly, but instead via (...) and [...] applied to a Tag or another Node object.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.DOM.Tag","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.DOM.Tag","text":"Represents a empty and attribute-less HTML element.\n\nUse @tags to define instances of this type rather than manually creating them via Tag(:tagname).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.DOM.escapehtml-Tuple{AbstractString}","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.DOM.escapehtml","text":"Escape characters in the provided string.

The behavior of HTMLWriter can be further customized by setting the format keyword of Documenter.makedocs to a HTML, which accepts the following keyword arguments: analytics, assets, canonical, disable_git, edit_link, prettyurls, collapselevel, sidebar_sitename, highlights, mathengine and footer.\n\nsitename is the site's title displayed in the title bar and at the top of the *navigation menu. It is also written into the inventory (see below). This argument is mandatory for HTMLWriter.\n\npages defines the hierarchy of the navigation menu.\n\nExperimental keywords\n\nversion specifies the version string of the current version which will be the selected option in the version selector. If this is left empty (default) the version selector will be hidden. The special value git-commit sets the value in the output to git:{commit}, where {commit} is the first few characters of the current commit hash.\n\nHTML Plugin options\n\nThe HTML object provides additional customization options for the HTMLWriter. For more information, see the HTML documentation.\n\nPage outline\n\nThe HTMLWriter makes use of the page outline that is determined by the headings. It is assumed that if the very first block of a page is a level 1 heading, then it is intended as the page title. This has two consequences:\n\nIt is then used to automatically determine the page title in the navigation menu and in the <title> tag, unless specified in the .pages option.\nIf the first heading is interpreted as being the page title, it is not displayed in the navigation sidebar.\n\nInventory\n\nThe HTMLWriter automatically generates an objects.inv \"inventory\" file in the output build folder. This file contains a list of all pages, headers and docstrings in the documentation, and a relative URL that can be used to link to those items from an external source.\n\nOther projects that build their documentation with Documenter can use the DocumenterInterLinks plugin to link to any other project with an inventory file, see External Cross-References.\n\nThe format of the objects.inv file is borrowed from the Sphinx project. It consists of a plain text header that includes the project name, taken from the sitename argument to Documenter.makedocs, and a project version taken from the inventory_version argument of the HTML options, or automatically determined by deploydocs for tagged releases. The bulk of the file is a list of plain text records, compressed with gzip. See Inventory Generation for details on these records.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.HTMLWriter.ASSETS","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.HTMLWriter.ASSETS","text":"The root directory of the HTML assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"constant"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.HTMLWriter.ASSETS_SASS","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.HTMLWriter.ASSETS_SASS","text":"The directory where all the Sass/SCSS files needed for theme building are.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"constant"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.HTMLWriter.ASSETS_THEMES","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.HTMLWriter.ASSETS_THEMES","text":"Directory for the compiled CSS files of the themes.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"constant"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.HTMLWriter.OUTDATED_VERSION_ATTR","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.HTMLWriter.OUTDATED_VERSION_ATTR","text":"Data attribute for the script inserting a warning for outdated docs.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"constant"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.HTMLWriter.THEMES","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.HTMLWriter.THEMES","text":"List of Documenter native themes.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"constant"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.HTMLWriter.HTML","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.HTMLWriter.HTML","text":"HTML(kwargs...)\n\nSets the behavior of HTMLWriter.\n\nKeyword arguments\n\nprettyurls (default true) – allows toggling the pretty URLs feature.\n\nBy default (i.e., when prettyurls is set to true), Documenter creates a directory structure that hides the .html suffixes from the URLs (e.g., by default src/foo.md becomes src/foo/index.html, but can be accessed via src/foo/ in the browser). This structure is preferred when publishing the generated HTML files as a website (e.g., on GitHub Pages), which is Documenter's primary use case. However, when building locally, viewing the resulting pages requires a running webserver. It is recommended to use the LiveServer package for this.\n\nIf prettyurls = false, then Documenter generates src/foo.html instead.\n\ndisable_git can be used to disable calls to git when the document is not in a Git-controlled repository. Without setting this to true, Documenter will throw an error and exit if any of the Git commands fail. The calls to Git are mainly used to gather information about the current commit hash and file paths, necessary for constructing the links to the remote repository.\n\nedit_link can be used to specify which branch, tag or commit (when passed a String) in the remote repository the edit buttons point to. If a special Symbol value :commit is passed, the current commit will be used instead. If set to nothing, the link edit link will be hidden altogether. By default, Documenter tries to determine it automatically by looking at the origin remote, and falls back to \"master\" if that fails.\n\nrepolink can be used to override the URL of the Git repository link in the top navbar (if passed a String). By default, Documenter attempts to determine the link from the Git remote of the repository (e.g. specified via the remotes argument of makedocs). Passing a nothing disables the repository link.\n\ncanonical specifies the canonical URL for your documentation. We recommend you set this to the base url of your stable documentation, e.g. https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable. This allows search engines to know which version to send their users to. See wikipedia for more information. Default is nothing, in which case no canonical link is set.\n\nassets can be used to include additional assets (JS, CSS, ICO etc. files). See below for more information.\n\nanalytics can be used specify the Google Analytics tracking ID.\n\ncollapselevel controls the navigation level visible in the sidebar. Defaults to 2. To show fewer levels by default, set collapselevel = 1.\n\nsidebar_sitename determines whether the site name is shown in the sidebar or not. Setting it to false can be useful when the logo already contains the name of the package. Defaults to true.\n\nhighlights can be used to add highlighting for additional languages. By default, Documenter already highlights all the \"Common\" highlight.js languages and Julia (julia, julia-repl). Additional languages must be specified by their filenames as they appear on CDNJS for the highlight.js version Documenter is using. E.g. to include highlighting for YAML and LLVM IR, you would set highlights = [\"llvm\", \"yaml\"]. Note that no verification is done whether the provided language names are sane.\n\nmathengine specifies which LaTeX rendering engine will be used to render the math blocks. The options are either KaTeX (default), MathJax v2, or MathJax v3, enabled by passing an instance of KaTeX, MathJax2, or MathJax3 objects, respectively. The rendering engine can further be customized by passing options to the KaTeX or MathJax2/MathJax3 constructors.\n\ndescription is the site-wide description that displays in page previews and search engines. Defaults to \"Documentation for $sitename\", where sitename is defined as an argument to makedocs.\n\nfooter can be a valid single-line markdown String or nothing and is displayed below the page navigation. Defaults to \"Powered by [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) and the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/).\".\n\nansicolor can be used to globally disable colored output from @repl and @example blocks by setting it to false (default: true).\n\nlang specifies the lang attribute of the top-level <html> element, declaring the language of the generated pages. The default value is \"en\".\n\nwarn_outdated inserts a warning if the current page is not the newest version of the documentation.\n\nexample_size_threshold specifies the size threshold above which the @example and other block outputs get written to files, rather than being included in the HTML page. This mechanism is present to reduce the size of the generated HTML files that contain a lot of figures etc. Setting it to nothing will disable writing to files, and setting to 0 means that all examples will be written to files. Defaults to 8 KiB.\n\nsize_threshold sets the maximum allowed HTML file size (in bytes) that Documenter is allowed to generate for a page. If the generated HTML file is larged than this, Documenter will throw an error and the build will fail. If set to nothing, the file sizes are not checked. Defaults to 200 KiB (but increases of this default value will be considered to be non-breaking).\n\nsize_threshold_warn: like size_threshold, but going over this limit will only cause Documenter to print a warning, instead of throwing an error. Defaults to 100 KiB, and must be less than or equal to size_threshold.\n\nsize_threshold_ignore can be passed a list of pages for which the size thresholds are completely ignored (silently). The arguments should be the same file paths as for the pages argument of makedocs. Using this argument to ignore a few specific pages is preferred over setting a high general limit, or disabling the size checking altogether.\n\nnote: Purpose of HTML size thresholds\nThe size threshold, with a reasonable default, exists so that users would not deploy huge pages accidentally (which among other this will result in bad UX for the readers and negatively impacts SEO). It is relatively easy to have e.g. an @example produce a lot of output.\n\nExperimental options\n\nprerender a boolean (true or false (default)) for enabling prerendering/build time application of syntax highlighting of code blocks. Requires a node (NodeJS) executable to be available in PATH or to be passed as the node keyword.\n\nnode path to a node (NodeJS) executable used for prerendering.\n\nhighlightjs file path to custom highglight.js library to be used with prerendering.\n\ninventory_version a version string to write to the header of the objects.inv inventory file. This should be a valid version number without a v prefix. Defaults to the version defined in the Project.toml file in the parent folder of the documentation root. Setting this to an empty string leaves the version in the inventory unspecified until deploydocs runs and automatically sets the version for any tagged release.\n\nDefault and custom assets\n\nDocumenter copies all files under the source directory (e.g. /docs/src/) over to the compiled site. It also copies a set of default assets from /assets/html/ to the site's assets/ directory, unless the user already had a file with the same name, in which case the user's files overrides the Documenter's file. This could, in principle, be used for customizing the site's style and scripting.\n\nThe HTML output also links certain custom assets to the generated HTML documents, specifically a logo, a preview image, and additional javascript files. The asset files that should be linked must be placed in assets/, under the source directory (e.g /docs/src/assets) and must be on the top level (i.e. files in the subdirectories of assets/ are not linked).\n\nFor the logo, Documenter checks for the existence of assets/logo.{svg,png,webp,gif,jpg,jpeg}, in this order. The first one it finds gets displayed at the top of the navigation sidebar. It will also check for assets/logo-dark.{svg,png,webp,gif,jpg,jpeg} and use that for dark themes.\n\nSimilarly, for the preview image, Documenter checks for the existence of assets/preview.{png,webp,gif,jpg,jpeg} in order. Assuming that canonical has been set, the canonical URL for the image gets constructed, , and a set of HTML <meta> tags are generated for the image, ensuring that the image shows up in link previews. The preview image will not be shown if canonical is not set.\n\nAdditional JS, ICO, and CSS assets can be included in the generated pages by passing them as a list with the assets keyword. Each asset will be included in the <head> of every page in the order in which they are given. The type of the asset (i.e. whether it is going to be included with a <script> or a <link> tag) is determined by the file's extension – either .js, .ico[1], or .css (unless overridden with asset).\n\nSimple strings are assumed to be local assets and that each correspond to a file relative to the documentation source directory (conventionally src/). Non-local assets, identified by their absolute URLs, can be included with the asset function.\n\n[1]: Adding an ICO asset is primarily useful for setting a custom favicon.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.HTMLWriter.HTMLContext","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.HTMLWriter.HTMLContext","text":"HTMLWriter-specific globals that are passed to domify and other recursive functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.HTMLWriter.KaTeX","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.HTMLWriter.KaTeX","text":"KaTeX(config::Dict = <default>, override = false)\n\nAn instance of the KaTeX type can be passed to HTML via the mathengine keyword to specify that the KaTeX rendering engine should be used in the HTML output to render mathematical expressions.\n\nA dictionary can be passed via the config argument to configure KaTeX.

In most cases makedocs should be run from a make.jl file:\n\nusing Documenter\nmakedocs(\n    # keywords...\n)\n\nwhich is then run from the command line with:\n\n$ julia make.jl\n\nThe folder structure that makedocs expects looks like:\n\ndocs/\n    build/\n    src/\n    make.jl\n\nKeywords\n\nroot is the directory from which makedocs should run. When run from a make.jl file this keyword does not need to be set. It is, for the most part, needed when repeatedly running makedocs from the Julia REPL like so:\n\njulia> makedocs(root = joinpath(dirname(pathof(MyModule)), \"..\", \"docs\"))\n\nsource is the directory, relative to root, where the markdown source files are read from. By convention this folder is called src. Note that any non-markdown files stored in source are copied over to the build directory when makedocs is run.\n\nbuild is the directory, relative to root, into which generated files and folders are written when makedocs is run. The name of the build directory is, by convention, called build, though, like with source, users are free to change this to anything else to better suit their project needs.\n\nclean tells makedocs whether to remove all the content from the build folder prior to generating new content from source. By default this is set to true.\n\ndoctest instructs makedocs on whether to try to test Julia code blocks that are encountered in the generated document. By default this keyword is set to true. Doctesting should only ever be disabled when initially setting up a newly developed package where the developer is just trying to get their package and documentation structure correct. After that, it's encouraged to always make sure that documentation examples are runnable and produce the expected results. See the Doctests manual section for details about running doctests.\n\nSetting doctest to :only allows for doctesting without a full build. In this mode, most build stages are skipped and the warnonly keyword is ignored (a doctesting error will always make makedocs throw an error in this mode).\n\nmodules specifies a vector of modules that should be documented in source. If any inline docstrings from those modules are seen to be missing from the generated content then a warning will be printed during execution of makedocs. By default no modules are passed to modules and so no warnings will appear. This setting can be used as an indicator of the \"coverage\" of the generated documentation. For example Documenter's make.jl file contains:\n\nmakedocs(\n    modules = [Documenter],\n    # ...\n)\n\nand so any docstring from the module Documenter that is not spliced into the generated documentation in build will raise a warning.\n\nrepo specifies the remote hosted Git repository (e.g. on github.com) related to the documentation build. It should be passed an object that subtypes and implements the Remotes.Remote interface (e.g. Remotes.GitHub). A template string can also be passed (interpreted according to the rules described in Remotes.URL), but the use of the template strings is discouraged, in favor of concrete Remotes.Remote objects.\n\nremotes can be used to declare a list additional path::AbstractString => remote pairs that are used to determine the remote repository URLs for local filesystem files, such as the edit links for manual Markdown pages, or docstring source links. path should be an absolute local filesystem path to a directory, and will be interpreted as the root of the remote repository specified with remote. remote would normally be Remote object, but can also be a (remote::Remote, commit::AbstractString) tuple, where the second argument specifies the commit within the repository. This is necessary when path is not pointing to a proper Git repository, and so determining the commit automatically is not possible.\n\nIf repo is not passed, makedocs will try to determine it automatically, either by inspecting the locally checked out Git repository, or via the remotes keyword. See the manual section on Remote repository links for more information on how the remote repository links are handled.\n\nIf remotes is set to nothing, all remote repository links (repository links, source links, edit links, issue links etc.) will be completely disabled. This can be useful when publicly deploying documentation for private packages.\n\nhighlightsig enables or disables automatic syntax highlighting of leading, unlabeled code blocks in docstrings (as Julia code). For example, if your docstring begins with an indented code block containing the function signature, then that block would be highlighted as if it were a labeled Julia code block. No other code blocks are affected. This feature is enabled by default.\n\nsitename is displayed in the title bar and/or the navigation menu when applicable.\n\npages can be use to specify a hierarchical page structure, and the order in which the pages appear in the navigation of the rendered output. If omitted, Documenter will automatically generate a flat list of pages based on the files present in the source directory.\n\npages = [\n    \"Overview\" => \"index.md\",\n    \"tutorial.md\",\n    \"Tutorial\" => [\n        \"tutorial/introduction.md\",\n        \"Advanced\" => \"tutorial/features.md\",\n    ],\n    \"apireference.md\",\n]\n\nThe pages keyword must be a list where each element must be one of the following:\n\nA string containing the full path of a Markdown file within the source directory (i.e. relative to the docs/src/ root in standard deployments).\nA \"Page title\" => \"path/to/page.md\" pair, where Page title overrides the page title in the navigation menu (but not on the page itself).\nA \"Subsection title\" => [...] pair, indicating a subsection of pages with the given title in the navigation menu. The list of pages for the subsection follow the same rules as the top-level pages keyword.\n\nSee also hide, which can be used to hide certain pages in the navigation menu.\n\nNote that, by default, regardless of what is specified in pages, Documenter will run and render all Markdown files it finds, even if they are not present in pages. The pagesonly keyword can be used to change this behaviour.\n\npagesonly can be set to true (default: false) to make Documenter process only the pages listed in with the pages keyword. In that case, the Markdown files not present in pages are ignored, i.e. code blocks do not run, docstrings do not get included, and the pages are not rendered in the output in any way.\n\nexpandfirst allows some of the pages to be expanded (i.e. at-blocks evaluated etc.) before the others. Documenter normally evaluates the files in the alphabetic order of their file paths relative to src, but expandfirst allows some pages to be prioritized.\n\nFor example, if you have foo.md and bar.md, bar.md would normally be evaluated before foo.md. But with expandfirst = [\"foo.md\"], you can force foo.md to be evaluated first.\n\nEvaluation order among the expandfirst pages is according to the order they appear in the argument.\n\ndraft can be set to true to build a draft version of the document. In draft mode some potentially time-consuming steps are skipped (e.g. running @example blocks), which is useful when iterating on the documentation. This setting can also be configured per-page by setting Draft = true in an @meta block.\n\ncheckdocs instructs makedocs to check whether all names within the modules defined in the modules keyword that have a docstring attached have the docstring also listed in the manual (e.g. there's a @docs block with that docstring). Possible values are :all (check all names; the default), :exports (check only exported names) and :none (no checks are performed).\n\nBy default, if the document check detect any errors, it will fail the documentation build. This behavior can be relaxed with the warnonly keyword.\n\nlinkcheck – if set to true makedocs uses curl to check the status codes of external-pointing links, to make sure that they are up-to-date. The links and their status codes are printed to the standard output. When enabled, any detected errors will fail the build, but this can be overridden by passing :linkcheck to warnonly. Default: false.\n\nlinkcheck_ignore allows certain URLs to be ignored in linkcheck. The values should be a list of strings (which get matched exactly) or Regex objects. By default nothing is ignored.\n\nlinkcheck_timeout configures how long curl waits (in seconds) for a link request to return a response before giving up. The default is 10 seconds.\n\nwarnonly can be used to control whether the makedocs build fails with an error, or simply prints a warning if it detects any issues with the document. Additionally, a Symbol or a Vector of Symbols can be passed to make Documenter warn for only those specified error classes (see also: Documenter.except). If set to true, the build should never fail due to document checks. The keyword defaults to false.\n\nNote that setting warnonly = true in general is not recommended, since it will make it very easy to miss Documentation build issues, and will lead to the deployment of broken manuals. The only case where you may want to consider passing true is when you are automatically deploying the documentation for a package release. In that case, warnonly should be set dynamically by checking the relevant environment variables set by the CI system.\n\nworkdir determines the working directory where @example and @repl code blocks are executed. It can be either a path or the special value :build (default).\n\nIf the workdir is set to a path, the working directory is reset to that path for each code block being evaluated. Relative paths are taken to be relative to root, but using absolute paths is recommended (e.g. workdir = joinpath(@__DIR__, \"..\") for executing in the package root for the usual docs/make.jl setup).\n\nWith the default :build option, the working directory is set to a subdirectory of build, determined from the source file path. E.g. for src/foo.md it is set to build/, for src/foo/bar.md it is set to build/foo etc.\n\nNote that workdir does not affect doctests.\n\nplugins is a list of Documenter.Plugin objects. Use as directed by the documentation of a third-party plugin. For any subtype T <: Plugin, the plugins list may contain at most a single object of type T.\n\nOutput formats\n\nformat allows the output format to be specified. The default format is Documenter.HTML which creates a set of HTML files, but Documenter also provides PDF output via the Documenter.LaTeX writer.\n\nOther formats can be enabled by using other addon-packages. For example, the DocumenterMarkdown package provides the original Markdown -> Markdown output. See the Other Output Formats for more information.\n\nSee Also\n\nA guide detailing how to document a package using Documenter's makedocs is provided in the setup guide in the manual.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/public/#Documenter.except","page":"Public API","title":"Documenter.except","text":"Documenter.except(errors...)\n\nReturns the list of all valid error classes that can be passed as the warnonly argument of makedocs, except for the ones specified in the errors argument. Each error class must be a Symbol and passed as a separate argument.\n\nThis can be used to enable strict error checking for only the listed error classes, while having other error types simply print a warning. E.g. to make Documenter fail the build only for footnote and linkcheck errors, one can set warnonly as\n\nmakedocs(...,\n    warnonly = Documenter.except(:linkcheck, :footnote),\n)\n\nThe possible Symbol values that can be passed to the function are: :autodocs_block, :cross_references, :docs_block, :doctest, :eval_block, :example_block, :footnote, :linkcheck_remotes, :linkcheck, :meta_block, :missing_docs, :parse_error, and :setup_block.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/public/#Documenter.hide","page":"Public API","title":"Documenter.hide","text":"hide(page)\n\n\nAllows a page to be hidden in the navigation menu.

Otherwise the docs are deployed to the directory determined by the devurl argument.\n\nThe deployment procedure consists of the following steps:\n\nCheck out the branch of repo to a temporary location.\nRemove the existing deployment (sub-)directory with git rm -r.\nCopy the target (build) folder to the deployment directory.\nGenerate index.html, and versions.js in the branch root and siteinfo.js in the deployment directory.\nAdd all files on the deployment branch (git add -A .), commit them, and push the repo. Note that any .gitignore files in the target directory affect which files will be committed to branch.\n\nnote: Note\nThe index.html will be created at the branch root if and only if one of the following two conditions hold:No such file already exists.\nThe file exists and starts with the HTML comment\n<!--This file is automatically generated by Documenter.jl-->\n\nRequired keyword arguments\n\nrepo is the remote repository where generated HTML content should be pushed to. Do not specify any protocol - \"https://\" or \"git@\" should not be present. This keyword must be set and will throw an error when left undefined. For example this package uses the following repo value:\n\nrepo = \"github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl.git\"\n\nOptional keyword arguments\n\ndeploy_config determines configuration for the deployment. If this is not specified Documenter will try to autodetect from the currently running environment. See the manual section about Deployment systems.\n\nroot has the same purpose as the root keyword for makedocs.\n\ntarget is the directory, relative to root, where generated content that should be deployed to gh-pages is written to. It should generally be the same as makedocs's build and defaults to \"build\".\n\nbranch is the branch where the generated documentation is pushed. If the branch does not exist, a new orphaned branch is created automatically. It defaults to \"gh-pages\".\n\ndirname is a subdirectory of branch that the docs should be added to. By default, it is \"\", which will add the docs to the root directory.\n\ncname is the CNAME where the documentation will be hosted, which is equivalent to the GitHub Pages \"Custom domain\" setting in the repository settings. If set, it will be used to generate the CNAME file, which has a higher priority than the GitHub Pages settings.\n\ndevbranch is the branch that \"tracks\" the in-development version of the generated documentation. By default Documenter tries to figure this out using git. Can be set explicitly as a string (typically \"master\" or \"main\").\n\ndevurl the folder that in-development version of the docs will be deployed. Defaults to \"dev\".\n\nforcepush a boolean that specifies the behavior of the git-deployment. The default (forcepush = false) is to push a new commit, but when forcepush = true the changes will be combined with the previous commit and force pushed, erasing the Git history on the deployment branch.\n\nversions determines content and order of the resulting version selector in the generated html. The following entries are valid in the versions vector:\n\n\"v#\": includes links to the latest documentation for each major release cycle (i.e. v2.0, v1.1).\n\"v#.#\": includes links to the latest documentation for each minor release cycle (i.e. v2.0, v1.1, v1.0, v0.1).\n\"v#.#.#\": includes links to all released versions.\n\"v^\": includes a link to the docs for the maximum version (i.e. a link vX.Y pointing to vX.Y.Z for highest X, Y, Z, respectively).\nA pair, e.g. \"first\" => \"second\", which will put \"first\" in the selector, and generate a url from which \"second\" can be accessed. The second argument can be \"v^\", to point to the maximum version docs (as in e.g. \"stable\" => \"v^\").\n\nIf versions = nothing documentation will be deployed directly to the \"root\", i.e. not to a versioned subfolder. See the manual section on Deploying without the versioning scheme for more details.\n\npush_preview a boolean that specifies if preview documentation should be deployed from pull requests or not. If your published documentation is hosted at \"https://USER.github.io/PACKAGE.jl/stable, by default the preview will be hosted at \"https://USER.github.io/PACKAGE.jl/previews/PR##\". This feature works for pull requests with head branch in the same repository, i.e. not from forks.\n\nbranch_previews is the branch to which pull request previews are deployed. It defaults to the value of branch.\n\nrepo_previews is the remote repository to which pull request previews are deployed. It defaults to the value of repo.\n\nnote: Note\nPull requests made from forks will not have previews. Hosting previews requires access to the deploy key. Therefore, previews are available only for pull requests that were submitted directly from the main repository. On GitHub Actions, GITHUB_TOKEN must be present for previews to work, even if DOCUMENTER_KEY ise being used to deploy.\n\nnote: Note\nPreviews generated are NOT automatically cleaned up. This can be done manually or automated. A GitHub Actions workflow for automating the same can be found here.\n\ndeps can be set to a function or a callable object and gets called during deployment, and is usually used to install additional dependencies. By default, nothing gets executed.\n\nmake can be set to a function or a callable object and gets called during deployment, and is usually used to specify additional build steps. By default, nothing gets executed.\n\ntag_prefix can be set to allow prefixed version numbers to determine the version number of a release. If tag_prefix = \"\" (the default), only version tags will trigger deployment; with a non-empty tag_prefix, only version tags with that prefix will trigger deployment. See manual sections on Documentation Versions and Deploying from a monorepo for more details.\n\nReleases vs development branches\n\ndeploydocs will automatically figure out whether it is deploying the documentation for a tagged release or just a development branch (usually, based on the environment variables set by the CI system).\n\nWith versioned tags, deploydocs discards the build metadata (i.e. + and everything that follows it) from the version number when determining the name of the directory into which the documentation gets deployed, as well as the tag_prefix (if present). Pre-release identifiers are preserved.\n\nSee Also\n\nThe Hosting Documentation section of the manual provides a step-by-step guide to using the deploydocs function to automatically generate docs and push them to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/public/#Documenter.doctest","page":"Public API","title":"Documenter.doctest","text":"doctest(package::Module; kwargs...)\n\nConvenience method that runs and checks all the doctests for a given Julia package. package must be the Module object corresponding to the top-level module of the package.

(#2051, #2194)\nFor upgrading: If you are running with strict = true, you can just drop the strict option. If you are currently being strict about specific error classes, you can invert the list of error classes with Documenter.except.\nIf you were not setting the strict keyword, but your build is failing now, you should first endeavor to fix the errors that are causing the build to fail. If that is not feasible, you can exclude specific error categories from failing the build (e.g. warnonly = [:footnote, :cross_references]). Finally, setting warnonly = true can be used to recover the old strict = false default behavior, turning all errors back into warnings.\nThe Markdown backend has been fully removed from the Documenter package, in favor of the external DocumenterMarkdown package. This includes the removal of the exported Deps module. (#1826)\nFor upgrading: To keep using the Markdown backend, refer to the DocumenterMarkdown package. That package might not immediately support the latest Documenter version, however.\n@eval blocks now require the last expression to be either nothing or of type Markdown.MD, with other cases now issuing an :eval_block error, and falling back to a text representation of the object. (#1919, #2260)\nFor upgrading: The cases where an @eval results in a object that is not nothing or ::Markdown.MD, the returned object should be reviewed. In case the resulting object is of some Markdown node type (e.g. Markdown.Paragraph or Markdown.Table), it can simply be wrapped in Markdown.MD([...]) for block nodes, or Markdown.MD([Markdown.Paragraph([...])]) for inline nodes. In other cases Documenter was likely not handling the returned object in a correct way, but please open an issue if this change has broken a previously working use case. The error can be ignored by passing :eval_block to the warnonly keyword.\nThe handling of remote repository (e.g. GitHub) URLs has been overhauled. (#1808, #1881, #2081, #2232)\nIn addition to generating source and edit links for the main repository, Documenter can now also be configured to generate correct links for cases where some files are from a different repository (e.g. with vendored dependencies). There have also been changes and fixes to the way the automatic detection of source and edit links works.\nThe fallbacks to TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG and GITHUB_REPOSITORY variables have been removed in favor of explicitly specifying the repo keyword in the makedocs call.\nDocumenter is now also more strict about the cases where it is unable to determine the URLs, and therefore previously successful builds may break.\nFor upgrading: As the fallbacks to CI variables have been removed, make sure that you have your source checked out as a proper Git repository when building the documentation, so that Documenter could determine the repository link automatically from the Git origin URL. On GitHub Actions, this should normally already be the case, and user action is unlikely to be necessary. In other cases, if necessary, you can configure the repo and/or remotes keywords of makedocs appropriately.\nThese changes should mostly affect more complex builds that include docstrings or files from various sources, such as when including docstrings from multiple packages. In the latter case in particular, you should make sure that all the relevant packages are also fully cloned and added as development dependencies to the docs/Project.toml (or equivalent) environment (or that the remotes keyword is configured for the Pkg.add-ed packages).\nFinally, in general, even if the build succeeds, double check that the various remote links (repository links, source links, edits links) have been generated correctly. If you run into any unexpected errors, please open an issue.\nDocumenter now checks that local links (e.g. to other Markdown files, local images; such as [see the other page](other.md)) are pointing to existing files. (#2130, #2187)\nThis can cause existing builds to fail because previously broken links are now caught by the Documenter's document checks, in particular because Documenter now runs in strict mode by default.\nFor upgrading: You should double check and fix all the offending links. Alternatively, you can also set warnonly = :cross_references, so that the errors would be reduced to warnings (however, this is not recommended, as you will have broken links in your generated documentation).\nThe HTML output now enforces size thresholds for the generated HTML files, to catch cases where Documenter is deploying extremely large HTML files (usually due to generated content, like figures). If any generated HTML file is above either of the thresholds, Documenter will either error and fail the build (if above size_threshold), or warn (if above size_threshold_warn). The size threshold can also be ignored for specific pages with size_threshold_ignore. (#2142, #2205, #2211, #2252)\nFor upgrading: If your builds are now failing due to the size threshold checks, you should first investigate why the generated HTML files are so large (e.g. you are likely automatically generating too much HTML, like extremely large inline SVG figures), and try to reduce them below the default thresholds. If you are unable to reduce the generated file size, you can increase the size_threshold value to just above the maximum size, or disable the enforcement of size threshold checks altogether by setting size_threshold = nothing. If it is just a few specific pages that are offending, you can also ignore those with size_threshold_ignore.\nUser-provided assets/search.js file no longer overrides Documenter's default search implementation, and the user-provided files will now be ignored by default. (#2236)\nFor upgrading: The JS file can still be included via the assets keyword of format = HTML(...). However, it will likely conflict with Documenter's default search implementation.

(#1989, #1271)\nDocumenter is now more careful not to accidentally leak SSH keys (in e.g. error messages) by removing DOCUMENTER_KEY from the environment when it is not needed. (#1958, #1962)\nAdmonitions are now styled with color in the LaTeX output. (#1931, #1932, #1946, #1955)\nImproved the styling of code blocks in the LaTeXWriter. (#1933, #1935, #1936, #1944, #1956, #1957)\nAutomatically resize oversize tabular environments from @example blocks in LaTeXWriter. (#1930, #1937)\nThe ansicolor keyword to HTML() now defaults to true, meaning that executed outputs from @example- and @repl-blocks are now by default colored (if they emit colored output). (#1828)\nDocumenter now shows a link to the root of the repository in the top navigation bar. The link is determined automatically from the remote repository, unless overridden or disabled via the repolink argument of HTML. (#1254)\nA more general API is now available to configure the remote repository URLs via the repo argument of makedocs by passing objects that are subtypes of Remotes.Remote and implement its interface (e.g. Remotes.GitHub). (#1808, #1881)\nBroken issue references (i.e. links like [#1234](@ref), but when Documenter is unable to determine the remote GitHub repository) now generate :cross_references errors that can be caught via the strict keyword. (#1808)\nThis is potentially breaking as it can cause previously working builds to fail if they are being run in strict mode. However, such builds were already leaving broken links in the generated documentation.\nFor upgrading: the easiest way to fix the build is to remove the offending @ref links. Alternatively, the repo argument to makedocs can be set to the appropriate Remotes.Remote object that implements the Remotes.issueurl function, which would make sure that correct URLs are generated.\nWoodpecker CI is now automatically supported for documentation deployment. (#1880)\nThe @contents-block now support UnitRanges for the Depth argument. This makes it possible to configure also the minimal header depth that should be displayed (Depth = 2:3, for example). This is supported by the HTML and the LaTeX/PDF backends. (#245, #1890)\nThe code copy buttons in HTML now have title and aria-label attributes. (#1903)\nThe at-ref links are now more flexible, allowing arbitrary links to point to both docstrings and section headings. (#781, #1900)\nCode blocks like @example or @repl are now also expanded in nested contexts (e.g. admonitions, lists or block quotes). (#491, #1970)\nThe new pagesonly keyword to makedocs can be used to restrict builds to just the Markdown files listed in pages (as opposed to all .md files under src/). (#1980)\nSearch engine and social media link previews are now supported, with Documenter generating the relevant HTML meta tags. (#1321, #1991)\ndeploydocs now supports custom tag prefixes; see section \"Deploying from a monorepo\" in the docs. (#1291, #1792, #1993)\nThe target keyword of deploydocs is now required to point to a subdirectory of root (usually the directory where make.jl is located). (#2019)\nAdded keyboard shortcuts for search box (Ctrl + / or Cmd + / to focus into the search box, Esc to focus out of it). (#1536, #2027)\nThe various JS and font dependencies of the HTML backend have been updated to the latest non-breaking versions.

(#1393, #2078)\nInvalid local link warnings during HTML rendering now print a bit more context, helping in pinpointing the offending link. (#2100)\nAdmonitions with category details are now rendered as (collapsed) <details> in the HTML backend. The admonition title is used as the <summary>. (#2128)\nTheme switcher now includes an \"Automatic (OS preference)\" option that makes the site follow the user's OS setting. (#1745, #2085, #2170)\nDocumenter now generates a .documenter-siteinfo.json file in the HTML build, that contains some metadata about the build. (#2181)\nThe search UI has had a complete overhaul, with a fresh new modal UI with better context for search results and a filter mechanism to remove unwanted results. The client-side search engine has been changed from LunrJs to MinisearchJs. (#1437, #2141, #2147, #2202)\nThe doctest routine can now receive the same plugins keyword argument as makedocs. This enables doctest to run if any plugin with a mandatory Plugin object is loaded, e.g., DocumenterCitations. (#2245)\nThe HTML output will automatically write larger @example-block outputs to files, to make the generated HTML files smaller. The size threshold can be controlled with the example_size_threshold option to HTML. (#2143, #2247)\nThe @docs and @autodocs blocks can now be declared non-canonical, allowing multiple copied of the same docstring to be included in the manual.

This requires Julia >= 1.6 and passing ansicolor=true to Documenter.HTML (e.g. makedocs(format=Documenter.HTML(ansicolor=true, ...), ...)). In Documenter 0.28.0 this will be the default so to (preemptively) opt-out pass ansicolor=false. (#1441, #1628, #1629, #1647)\nExperimental Documenter's HTML output can now prerender syntax highlighting of code blocks, i.e. syntax highlighting is applied when generating the HTML page rather than on the fly in the browser after the page is loaded. This requires (i) passing prerender=true to Documenter.HTML and (ii) a node (NodeJS) executable available in PATH. A path to a node executable can be specified by passing the node keyword argument to Documenter.HTML (for example from the NodeJS_16_jll Julia package). In addition, the highlightjs keyword argument can be used to specify a file path to a highlight.js library (if this is not given the release used by Documenter will be used). Example configuration:\nusing Documenter, NodeJS_16_jll\n\nmakedocs(;\n    format = Documenter.HTML(\n        prerender = true,            # enable prerendering\n        node = NodeJS_16_jll.node(), # specify node executable (required if not available in PATH)\n        # ...\n    )\n    # ...\n)\nThis feature is experimental and subject to change in future releases.

By default, Documenter now creates the stable/ directory (as before) and a directory for every minor version (vX.Y/). The release-X.Y directories are no longer created. (#706, #813, #817)\nTechnically, Documenter now deploys actual files only to dev/ and vX.Y.Z/ directories. The directories (URLs) that change from version to version (e.g. latest/, vX.Y) are implemented as symlinks on the gh-pages branch.\nThe version selector will only display vX.Y/, stable/ and dev/ directories by default. This behavior can be customized with the versions keyword of deploydocs.\nDocumentation from the development branch (e.g. master) now deploys to dev/ by default (instead of latest/). This can be customized with the devurl keyword. (#802)\nThe latest keyword to deploydocs has been deprecated and renamed to devbranch. (#802)\nThe julia and osname keywords to deploydocs are now deprecated. (#816)\nThe default values of the target, deps and make keywords to deploydocs have been changed. See the default format change below for more information. (#826)\nFor upgrading:\nIf you are using the latest keyword, then just use devbranch with the same value instead.\nUpdate links that point to latest/ to point to dev/ instead (e.g. in the README).\nRemove any links to the release-X.Y branches and remove the directories from your gh-pages branch.\nThe operating system and Julia version should be specified in the Travis build stage configuration (via julia: and os: options, see \"Hosting Documentation\" in the manual for more details) or by checking the TRAVIS_JULIA_VERSION and TRAVIS_OS_NAME environment variables in make.jl yourself.\nmakedocs will now build Documenter's native HTML output by default and deploydocs' defaults now assume the HTML output. (#826)\nThe default value of the format keyword of makedocs has been changed to :html.\nThe default value of the target keyword to deploydocs has been changed to \"build\".\nThe default value of the make and deps keywords to deploydocs have been changed to nothing.\nFor upgrading: If you are relying on the Markdown/MkDocs output, you now need to:\nIn makedocs, explicitly set format = :markdown\nIn deploydocs, explicitly set\ntarget = \"site\"\ndeps = Deps.pip(\"pygments\", \"mkdocs\")\nmake = () -> run(`mkdocs build`)\nExplicitly import DocumenterMarkdown in make.jl. See the MarkdownWriter deprecation below.\nIf you already specify any of the changed keywords, then you do not need to make any changes to those keywords you already set.\nHowever, if you are setting any of the values to the new defaults (e.g. when you are already using the HTML output), you may now rely on the new defaults.\n\"Pretty URLs\" are enabled by default now for the HTML output. The default value of the html_prettyurls has been changed to true.\nFor a page foo/page.md Documenter now generates foo/page/index.html, instead of foo/page.html. On GitHub pages deployments it means that your URLs look like  foo/page/ instead of foo/page.html.\nFor local builds you should explicitly set html_prettyurls = false.\nFor upgrading: If you wish to retain the old behavior, set html_prettyurls = false in makedocs. If you already set html_prettyurls, you do not need to change anything.\nThe Travis.genkeys and Documenter.generate functions have been moved to a separate DocumenterTools.jl package.
