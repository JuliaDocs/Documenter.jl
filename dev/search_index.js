In most cases makedocs should be run from a make.jl file:\n\nusing Documenter\nmakedocs(\n    # keywords...\n)\n\nwhich is then run from the command line with:\n\n$ julia make.jl\n\nThe folder structure that makedocs expects looks like:\n\ndocs/\n    build/\n    src/\n    make.jl\n\nKeywords\n\nroot is the directory from which makedocs should run. When run from a make.jl file this keyword does not need to be set. It is, for the most part, needed when repeatedly running makedocs from the Julia REPL like so:\n\njulia> makedocs(root = joinpath(dirname(pathof(MyModule)), \"..\", \"docs\"))\n\nsource is the directory, relative to root, where the markdown source files are read from. By convention this folder is called src. Note that any non-markdown files stored in source are copied over to the build directory when makedocs is run.\n\nbuild is the directory, relative to root, into which generated files and folders are written when makedocs is run. The name of the build directory is, by convention, called build, though, like with source, users are free to change this to anything else to better suit their project needs.\n\nclean tells makedocs whether to remove all the content from the build folder prior to generating new content from source. By default this is set to true.\n\ndoctest instructs makedocs on whether to try to test Julia code blocks that are encountered in the generated document. By default this keyword is set to true. Doctesting should only ever be disabled when initially setting up a newly developed package where the developer is just trying to get their package and documentation structure correct. After that, it's encouraged to always make sure that documentation examples are runnable and produce the expected results. See the Doctests manual section for details about running doctests.\n\nmodules specifies a vector of modules that should be documented in source. If any inline docstrings from those modules are seen to be missing from the generated content then a warning will be printed during execution of makedocs. By default no modules are passed to modules and so no warnings will appear. This setting can be used as an indicator of the \"coverage\" of the generated documentation. For example Documenter's make.jl file contains:\n\nmakedocs(\n    modules = [Documenter],\n    # ...\n)\n\nand so any docstring from the module Documenter that is not spliced into the generated documentation in build will raise a warning.\n\nrepo specifies a template for the \"link to source\" feature. If you are using GitHub, this is automatically generated from the remote. If you are using a different host, you can use this option to tell Documenter how URLs should be generated. The following placeholders will be replaced with the respective value of the generated link:\n\n{commit} Git branch or tag name, or commit hash\n{path} Path to the file in the repository\n{line} Line (or range of lines) in the source file\n\nFor example if you are using GitLab.com, you could use\n\nmakedocs(repo = \"https://gitlab.com/user/project/blob/{commit}{path}#{line}\")\n\nhighlightsig enables or disables automatic syntax highlighting of leading, unlabeled code blocks in docstrings (as Julia code). For example, if your docstring begins with an indented code block containing the function signature, then that block would be highlighted as if it were a labeled Julia code block. No other code blocks are affected. This feature is enabled by default.\n\nsitename is displayed in the title bar and/or the navigation menu when applicable.\n\nexpandfirst allows some of the pages to be expanded (i.e. at-blocks evaluated etc.) before the others. Documenter normally evaluates the files in the alphabetic order of their file paths relative to src, but expandfirst allows some pages to be prioritized.\n\nFor example, if you have foo.md and bar.md, bar.md would normally be evaluated before foo.md. But with expandfirst = [\"foo.md\"], you can force foo.md to be evaluated first.\n\nEvaluation order among the expandfirst pages is according to the order they appear in the argument.\n\nExperimental keywords\n\nIn addition to standard arguments there is a set of non-finalized experimental keyword arguments. The behaviour of these may change or they may be removed without deprecation when a minor version changes (i.e. except in patch releases).\n\ncheckdocs instructs makedocs to check whether all names within the modules defined in the modules keyword that have a docstring attached have the docstring also listed in the manual (e.g. there's a @docs blocks with that docstring). Possible values are :all (check all names) and :exports (check only exported names). The default value is :none, in which case no checks are performed. If strict is also enabled then the build will fail if any missing docstrings are encountered.\n\nlinkcheck – if set to true makedocs uses curl to check the status codes of external-pointing links, to make sure that they are up-to-date. The links and their status codes are printed to the standard output. If strict is also enabled then the build will fail if there are any broken (400+ status code) links. Default: false.\n\nlinkcheck_ignore allows certain URLs to be ignored in linkcheck. The values should be a list of strings (which get matched exactly) or Regex objects. By default nothing is ignored.\n\nstrict – makedocs fails the build right before rendering if it encountered any errors with the document in the previous build phases.\n\nworkdir determines the working directory where @example and @repl code blocks are executed. It can be either a path or the special value :build (default).\n\nIf the workdir is set to a path, the working directory is reset to that path for each code block being evaluated. Relative paths are taken to be relative to root, but using absolute paths is recommended (e.g. workdir = joinpath(@__DIR__, \"..\") for executing in the package root for the usual docs/make.jl setup).\n\nWith the default :build option, the working directory is set to a subdirectory of build, determined from the source file path. E.g. for src/foo.md it is set to build/, for src/foo/bar.md it is set to build/foo etc.\n\nNote that workdir does not affect doctests.\n\nOutput formats\n\nformat allows the output format to be specified. The default format is Documenter.HTML which creates a set of HTML files.\n\nThere are other possible formats that are enabled by using other addon-packages. For examples, the DocumenterMarkdown package define the DocumenterMarkdown.Markdown() format for use with e.g. MkDocs, and the DocumenterLaTeX package define the DocumenterLaTeX.LaTeX() format for LaTeX / PDF output. See the Other Output Formats for more information.\n\nSee Also\n\nA guide detailing how to document a package using Documenter's makedocs is provided in the setup guide in the manual.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/public/#Documenter.hide","page":"Public","title":"Documenter.hide","text":"hide(page)\n\n\nAllows a page to be hidden in the navigation menu.

Otherwise the docs are deployed to the directory determined by the devurl argument.\n\nRequired keyword arguments\n\nrepo is the remote repository where generated HTML content should be pushed to. Do not specify any protocol - \"https://\" or \"git@\" should not be present. This keyword must be set and will throw an error when left undefined. For example this package uses the following repo value:\n\nrepo = \"github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl.git\"\n\nOptional keyword arguments\n\nroot has the same purpose as the root keyword for makedocs.\n\ntarget is the directory, relative to root, where generated content that should be deployed to gh-pages is written to. written to. It should generally be the same as makedocs's build and defaults to \"build\".\n\nbranch is the branch where the generated documentation is pushed. If the branch does not exist, a new orphaned branch is created automatically. It defaults to \"gh-pages\".\n\ndeps is the function used to install any additional dependencies needed to build the documentation. By default nothing is installed.\n\nIt can be used e.g. for a Markdown build. The following example installed the pygments and mkdocs Python packages using the Deps.pip function:\n\ndeps = Deps.pip(\"pygments\", \"mkdocs\")\n\nmake is the function used to specify an additonal build phase. By default, nothing gets executed.\n\ndevbranch is the branch that \"tracks\" the in-development version of the  generated documentation. By default this value is set to \"master\".\n\ndevurl the folder that in-development version of the docs will be deployed. Defaults to \"dev\".\n\nforcepush a boolean that specifies the behavior of the git-deployment. The default (forcepush = false) is to push a new commit, but when forcepush = true the changes will be combined with the previous commit and force pushed, erasing the Git history on the deployment branch.\n\nversions determines content and order of the resulting version selector in the generated html. The following entries are valied in the versions vector:\n\n\"v#\": includes links to the latest documentation for each major release cycle (i.e. v2.0, v1.1).\n\"v#.#\": includes links to the latest documentation for each minor release cycle (i.e. v2.0, v1.1, v1.0, v0.1).\n\"v#.#.#\": includes links to all released versions.\n\"v^\": includes a link to the docs for the maximum version (i.e. a link vX.Y pointing to vX.Y.Z for highest X, Y, Z, respectively).\nA pair, e.g. \"first\" => \"second\", which will put \"first\" in the selector, and generate a url from which \"second\" can be accessed. The second argument can be \"v^\", to point to the maximum version docs (as in e.g. \"stable\" => \"v^\").\n\nEnvironment variables\n\ndeploydocs's behavior is influenced by the following environment variables, many of which are specific to the Travis CI platform.\n\nDOCUMENTER_KEY: must contain the Base64-encoded SSH private key for the repository.\nTRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST: must be set to false.\nThis avoids deployment on pull request builds. Note that there is no way to safely enable builds on pull requests, since that would expose the SSH private key (DOCUMENTER_KEY), giving anyone opening a pull request full write access to the repository.\nTRAVIS_REPO_SLUG: must match the value of the repo keyword.\nTRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE: may not be set to cron.\nThis avoids the re-deployment of existing docs on builds that were triggered by a Travis cron job.\nTRAVIS_BRANCH: unless TRAVIS_TAG is non-empty, this must have the same value as the devbranch keyword.\nThis makes sure that only the development branch (commonly, the master branch) will deploy the \"dev\" documentation (deployed into a directory specified by the devurl keyword).\nTRAVIS_TAG: if set, a tagged version deployment is performed instead; the value must be a valid version number (i.e. match Base.VERSION_REGEX).\nThe documentation for a package version tag gets deployed to a directory named after the version number in TRAVIS_TAG instead.\n\nThe TRAVIS_* variables are set automatically on Travis, but could be set manually to appropriate values as well to run deploydocs locally or on other CI platforms. More information on how Travis sets the TRAVIS_* variables can be found in the Travis documentation.\n\nSee Also\n\nThe Hosting Documentation section of the manual provides a step-by-step guide to using the deploydocs function to automatically generate docs and push them to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/public/#Documenter.Deps","page":"Public","title":"Documenter.Deps","text":"Exported module that provides build and deploy dependencies and related functions.\n\nCurrently only pip is implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"lib/public/#Documenter.Deps.pip","page":"Public","title":"Documenter.Deps.pip","text":"pip(deps)\n\n\nInstalls (as non-root user) all python packages listed in deps.\n\nExamples\n\nusing Documenter\n\nmakedocs(\n    # ...\n)\n\ndeploydocs(\n    deps = Deps.pip(\"pygments\", \"mkdocs\", \"mkdocs-material\"),\n    # ...\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/public/#DocumenterTools-1","page":"Public","title":"DocumenterTools","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"lib/public/#","page":"Public","title":"Public","text":"DocumenterTools.generate\nDocumenterTools.Travis.genkeys\nDocumenterTools.Travis","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/public/#DocumenterTools.generate","page":"Public","title":"DocumenterTools.generate","text":"DocumenterTools.generate(path::String = \"docs\"; name = nothing, format = :html)\n\nCreate a documentation stub in path, which is usually a sub folder in the package root.

This means that passing two vectors of nodes to a div will result in a div node with a single vector of children (the concatenation of the two vectors) rather than two vector children. The only arguments that are not flattened are nested nodes.\n\nString arguments are automatically converted into text nodes. Text nodes do not have any children or attributes and when displayed the string is escaped using escapehtml.\n\nAttributes\n\nAs well as plain nodes shown in the previous example, nodes can have attributes added to them using the following syntax.\n\ndiv[\".my-class\"](\n    img[:src => \"foo.jpg\"],\n    input[\"#my-id\", :disabled]\n)\n\nIn the above example we add a class = \"my-class\" attribute to the div node, a src = \"foo.jpg\" to the img, and id = \"my-id\" disabled attributes to the input node.\n\nThe following syntax is supported within [...]:\n\ntag[\"#id\"]\ntag[\".class\"]\ntag[\".class#id\"]\ntag[:disabled]\ntag[:src => \"foo.jpg\"]\n# ... or any combination of the above arguments.\n\nInternal Representation\n\nThe @tags macro defines named Tag objects as follows\n\n@tags div p em strong\n\nexpands to\n\nconst div, p, em, strong = Tag(:div), Tag(:p), Tag(:em), Tag(:strong)\n\nThese Tag objects are lightweight representations of empty HTML elements without any attributes and cannot be used to represent a complete document.

If this is left empty (default) the version selector will be hidden. The special value git-commit sets the value in the output to git:{commit}, where {commit} is the first few characters of the current commit hash.\n\nHTML Plugin options\n\nThe HTML Documenter.Plugin provides additional customization options for the HTMLWriter. For more information, see the HTML documentation.\n\nPage outline\n\nThe HTMLWriter makes use of the page outline that is determined by the headings. It is assumed that if the very first block of a page is a level 1 heading, then it is intended as the page title. This has two consequences:\n\nIt is then used to automatically determine the page title in the navigation menu and in the <title> tag, unless specified in the .pages option.\nIf the first heading is interpreted as being the page title, it is not displayed in the navigation sidebar.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.Writers.HTMLWriter.HTML","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.Writers.HTMLWriter.HTML","text":"HTML(kwargs...)\n\nSets the behavior of HTMLWriter.\n\nKeyword arguments\n\nprettyurls (default true) – allows toggling the pretty URLs feature.\n\nBy default (i.e. when prettyurls is set to true), Documenter creates a directory structure that hides the .html suffixes from the URLs (e.g. by default src/foo.md becomes src/foo/index.html, but can be accessed with via src/foo/ in the browser). This structure is preferred when publishing the generate HTML files as a website (e.g. on GitHub Pages), which is Documenter's primary use case.\n\nIf prettyurls = false, then Documenter generates src/foo.html instead, suitable for local documentation builds, as browsers do not normally resolve foo/ to foo/index.html for local files.\n\nTo have pretty URLs disabled in local builds, but still have them enabled for the automatic CI deployment builds, you can set prettyurls = get(ENV, \"CI\", nothing) == \"true\" (the specific environment variable you will need to check may depend on the CI system you are using, but this will work on Travis CI).\n\ndisable_git can be used to disable calls to git when the document is not in a Git-controlled repository. Without setting this to true, Documenter will throw an error and exit if any of the Git commands fail. The calls to Git are mainly used to gather information about the current commit hash and file paths, necessary for constructing the links to the remote repository.\n\nedit_branch specifies which branch, tag or commit the \"Edit on GitHub\" links point to. It defaults to master. If it set to nothing, the current commit will be used.\n\ncanonical specifies the canonical URL for your documentation. We recommend you set this to the base url of your stable documentation, e.g. https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable. This allows search engines to know which version to send their users to. See wikipedia for more information. Default is nothing, in which case no canonical link is set.\n\nanalytics can be used specify the Google Analytics tracking ID.\n\nassets can be used to include additional assets (JS, CSS, ICO etc. files). See below for more information.\n\nDefault and custom assets\n\nDocumenter copies all files under the source directory (e.g. /docs/src/) over to the compiled site. It also copies a set of default assets from /assets/html/ to the site's assets/ directory, unless the user already had a file with the same name, in which case the user's files overrides the Documenter's file. This could, in principle, be used for customizing the site's style and scripting.\n\nThe HTML output also links certain custom assets to the generated HTML documents, specifically a logo and additional javascript files. The asset files that should be linked must be placed in assets/, under the source directory (e.g /docs/src/assets) and must be on the top level (i.e. files in the subdirectories of assets/ are not linked).\n\nFor the logo, Documenter checks for the existence of assets/logo.{svg,png,webp,gif,jpg,jpeg}, in this order. The first one it finds gets displayed at the top of the navigation sidebar.\n\nAdditional JS, ICO, and CSS assets can be included in the generated pages using the assets keyword for makedocs. assets must be a Vector{String} and will include each listed asset in the <head> of every page in the order in which they are listed. The type of the asset (i.e. whether it is going to be included with a <script> or a <link> tag) is determined by the file's extension – either .js, .ico, or .css. Adding an ICO asset is primarilly useful for setting a custom favicon.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.Writers.HTMLWriter.MDBlockContext","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.Writers.HTMLWriter.MDBlockContext","text":"MDBlockContext is a union of all the Markdown nodes whose children should be blocks.
