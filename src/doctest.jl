# Implements doctest()

"""
    doctest(package::Module; kwargs...)

Convenience method that runs and checks all the doctests for a given Julia package.
`package` must be the `Module` object corresponding to the top-level module of the package.
Behaves like an `@testset` call, returning a testset if all the doctests are successful or
throwing a `TestSetException` if there are any failures. Can be included in other testsets.

# Keywords

**`manual`** controls how manual pages are handled. By default (`manual = true`), `doctest`
assumes that manual pages are located under `docs/src`. If that is not the case, the
`manual` keyword argument can be passed to specify the directory. Setting `manual = false`
will skip doctesting of manual pages altogether.

Additional keywords are passed on to the main [`doctest`](@ref) method.

end

"""
    doctest(source, modules; kwargs...)

Runs all the doctests in the given modules and on manual pages under the `source` directory.
Behaves like an `@testset` call, returning a testset if all the doctests are successful or
throwing a `TestSetException` if there are any failures. Can be included in other testsets.

The manual pages are searched recursively in subdirectories of `source` too. Doctesting of
manual pages can be disabled if `source` is set to `nothing`.

# Keywords

**`testset`** specifies the name of test testset (default `Doctests`).

**`doctestfilters`** vector of regex to filter tests (see the manual on [Filtering Doctests](@ref))

**`fix`**, if set to `true`, updates all the doctests that fail with the correct output
(default `false`).

!!! warning
    When running `doctest(...; fix=true)`, Documenter will modify the Markdown and Julia
    source files. It is strongly recommended that you only run it on packages in Pkg's
    develop mode and commit any staged changes. You should also review all the changes made
    by `doctest` before committing them, as there may be edge cases when the automatic
    fixing fails.
