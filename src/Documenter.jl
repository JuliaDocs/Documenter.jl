Main module for `Documenter.jl` -- a documentation generation package for Julia.

Two functions are exported from this module for public use:

- [`makedocs`](@ref). Generates documentation from docstrings and templated markdown files.
- [`deploydocs`](@ref). Deploys generated documentation from *Travis-CI* to *GitHub Pages*.

Any plugin that needs to either solicit user input or store information in a
[`Documents.Document`](@ref) should create a subtype of [`Plugin`](@ref). The
subtype, `T <: Documenter.Plugin`, must have an empty constructor `T()` that
initialized `T` with the appropriate default values.

To retrieve the values stored in `T`, the plugin can call [`Documents.getplugin`](@ref).
If `T` was passed to [`makedocs`](@ref), the passed type will be returned. Otherwise,
a new `T` object will be created.

        root    = "<current-directory>",

Combines markdown files and inline docstrings into an interlinked document.
In most cases [`makedocs`](@ref) should be run from a `make.jl` file:

```julia
using Documenter
makedocs(
    # keywords...
)
```

which is then run from the command line with:

```sh
\$ julia make.jl
```

The folder structure that [`makedocs`](@ref) expects looks like:

    docs/
        build/
        src/
        make.jl

# Keywords

**`root`** is the directory from which `makedocs` should run. When run from a `make.jl` file
this keyword does not need to be set. It is, for the most part, needed when repeatedly
running `makedocs` from the Julia REPL like so:

    julia> makedocs(root = joinpath(pathof(MyModule), "..", "..", "docs"))

**`source`** is the directory, relative to `root`, where the markdown source files are read
from. By convention this folder is called `src`. Note that any non-markdown files stored
in `source` are copied over to the build directory when [`makedocs`](@ref) is run.

**`build`** is the directory, relative to `root`, into which generated files and folders are
written when [`makedocs`](@ref) is run. The name of the build directory is, by convention,
called `build`, though, like with `source`, users are free to change this to anything else
to better suit their project needs.

**`clean`** tells [`makedocs`](@ref) whether to remove all the content from the `build`
folder prior to generating new content from `source`. By default this is set to `true`.

**`doctest`** instructs [`makedocs`](@ref) on whether to try to test Julia code blocks
that are encountered in the generated document. By default this keyword is set to `true`.
Doctesting should only ever be disabled when initially setting up a newly developed package
where the developer is just trying to get their package and documentation structure correct.
After that, it's encouraged to always make sure that documentation examples are runnable and
produce the expected results. See the [Doctests](@ref) manual section for details about
running doctests.

**`modules`** specifies a vector of modules that should be documented in `source`. If any
inline docstrings from those modules are seen to be missing from the generated content then
a warning will be printed during execution of [`makedocs`](@ref). By default no modules are
passed to `modules` and so no warnings will appear. This setting can be used as an indicator
of the "coverage" of the generated documentation.
For example Documenter's `make.jl` file contains:

```julia
makedocs(
    modules = [Documenter],
    # ...
)
```

and so any docstring from the module `Documenter` that is not spliced into the generated
documentation in `build` will raise a warning.

**`repo`** specifies a template for the "link to source" feature. If you are
using GitHub, this is automatically generated from the remote. If you are using
a different host, you can use this option to tell Documenter how URLs should be
generated. The following placeholders will be replaced with the respective
value of the generated link:

  - `{commit}` Git branch or tag name, or commit hash
  - `{path}` Path to the file in the repository
  - `{line}` Line (or range of lines) in the source file

For example if you are using GitLab.com, you could use

```julia
makedocs(repo = \"https://gitlab.com/user/project/blob/{commit}{path}#{line}\")
```

# Experimental keywords

In addition to standard arguments there is a set of non-finalized experimental keyword
arguments. The behaviour of these may change or they may be removed without deprecation
when a minor version changes (i.e. except in patch releases).

**`checkdocs`** instructs [`makedocs`](@ref) to check whether all names within the modules
defined in the `modules` keyword that have a docstring attached have the docstring also
listed in the manual (e.g. there's a `@docs` blocks with that docstring). Possible values
are `:all` (check all names) and `:exports` (check only exported names). The default value
is `:none`, in which case no checks are performed. If `strict` is also enabled then the
build will fail if any missing docstrings are encountered.

**`linkcheck`** -- if set to `true` [`makedocs`](@ref) uses `curl` to check the status codes
of external-pointing links, to make sure that they are up-to-date. The links and their
status codes are printed to the standard output. If `strict` is also enabled then the build
will fail if there are any broken (400+ status code) links. Default: `false`.

**`linkcheck_ignore`** allows certain URLs to be ignored in `linkcheck`. The values should
be a list of strings (which get matched exactly) or `Regex` objects. By default nothing is
ignored.

**`strict`** -- [`makedocs`](@ref) fails the build right before rendering if it encountered
any errors with the document in the previous build phases.

## Output formats
**`format`** allows the output format to be specified. The default value is `:html`. Other
formats can be enabled by using other packages. For examples, see the `DocumenterMarkdown`
and `DocumenterLaTeX` packages.

Documenter is designed to support multiple output formats. By default it is creates a set of
HTML files, but the output format can be controlled with the `format` keyword. The different
output formats may require additional keywords to be specified via plugins. The keywords for
the default HTML output are documented for the [`Writers.HTMLWriter.HTML`](@ref) type.

The default `:html` output format creates a set of HTML files, but Documenter is designed to
support multiple output formats. Via plugin packages, Documenter also supports e.g. Markdown
/ MkDocs and LaTeX / PDF outputs. See the [Other Output Formats](@ref) for more information.

$(SIGNATURES)

Allows a page to be hidden in the navigation menu. It will only show up if it happens to be
the current page. The hidden page will still be present in the linear page list that can be
accessed via the previous and next page links. The title of the hidden page can be overriden
using the `=>` operator as usual.

# Usage

```julia
makedocs(

    pages = [
        ...,
        hide("page1.md"),
        hide("Title" => "page2.md")

$(SIGNATURES)

Allows a subsection of pages to be hidden from the navigation menu. `root` will be linked
to in the navigation menu, with the title determined as usual. `children` should be a list
of pages (note that it **can not** be hierarchical).

# Usage

```julia
makedocs(
    ...,
    pages = [
        ...,
        hide("Hidden section" => "hidden_index.md", [
            "hidden1.md",

    deploydocs(
        root   = "<current-directory>",
        target = "build",
        repo   = "<required>",
        branch = "gh-pages",
        deps   = nothing | <Function>,

        versions = ["stable" => "v^", "v#.#", devurl => devurl]
    )

Converts markdown files generated by [`makedocs`](@ref) to HTML and pushes them to `repo`.
This function should be called from within a package's `docs/make.jl` file after the call to
[`makedocs`](@ref), like so

```julia
using Documenter, PACKAGE_NAME
makedocs(
    # options...
)
deploydocs(
    repo = "github.com/..."
)
```

When building the docs for a tag (i.e. a release) the documentation is deployed to
a directory with the tag name (i.e. `vX.Y.Z`) and to the `stable` directory.
Otherwise the docs are deployed to the directory determined by the `devurl` argument.

# Required keyword arguments

**`repo`** is the remote repository where generated HTML content should be pushed to. Do not
specify any protocol - "https://" or "git@" should not be present. This keyword *must*
be set and will throw an error when left undefined. For example this package uses the
following `repo` value:

```julia
repo = "github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl.git"
```

# Optional keyword arguments

**`root`** has the same purpose as the `root` keyword for [`makedocs`](@ref).

**`target`** is the directory, relative to `root`, where generated content that should be
deployed to `gh-pages` is written to. written to. It should generally be the same as
[`makedocs`](@ref)'s `build` and defaults to `"build"`.

**`branch`** is the branch where the generated documentation is pushed. If the branch does
not exist, a new orphaned branch is created automatically. It defaults to `"gh-pages"`.

**`deps`** is the function used to install any additional dependencies needed to build the
documentation. By default nothing is installed.

It can be used e.g. for a Markdown build. The following example installed the `pygments` and
`mkdocs` Python packages using the [`Deps.pip`](@ref) function:

```julia
deps = Deps.pip("pygments", "mkdocs")
```

**`make`** is the function used to specify an additonal build phase. By default, nothing gets
executed.

**`devbranch`** is the branch that "tracks" the in-development version of the  generated
documentation. By default this value is set to `"master"`.

**`devurl`** the folder that in-development version of the docs will be deployed.
Defaults to `"dev"`.

**`versions`** determines content and order of the resulting version selector in
the generated html. The following entries are valied in the `versions` vector:
 - `"v#"`: includes links to the latest documentation for each major release cycle
   (i.e. `v2.0`, `v1.1`).
 - `"v#.#"`: includes links to the latest documentation for each minor release cycle
   (i.e. `v2.0`, `v1.1`, `v1.0`, `v0.1`).
 - `"v#.#.#"`: includes links to all released versions.
 - `"v^"`: includes a link to the docs for the maximum version
   (i.e. a link `vX.Y` pointing to `vX.Y.Z` for highest `X`, `Y`, `Z`, respectively).
 - A pair, e.g. `"first" => "second"`, which will put `"first"` in the selector,
   and generate a url from which `"second"` can be accessed.
   The second argument can be `"v^"`, to point to the maximum version docs
   (as in e.g. `"stable" => "v^"`).

    gitrm_copy(src, dst)

Uses `git rm -r` to remove `dst` and then copies `src` to `dst`. Assumes that the working
directory is within the git repository of `dst` is when the function is called.

This is to get around [#507](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/507) on
filesystems that are case-insensitive (e.g. on OS X, Windows). Without doing a `git rm`
first, `git add -A` will not detect case changes in filenames.
