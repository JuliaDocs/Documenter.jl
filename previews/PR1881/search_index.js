Define the ones we actually need.\n@tags div p em strong ul li\n\ndiv(\n    p(\"This \", em(\"is\"), \" a \", strong(\"paragraph.\"),\n    p(\"And this is \", strong(\"another\"), \" one\"),\n    ul(\n        li(\"and\"),\n        li(\"an\"),\n        li(\"unordered\"),\n        li(\"list\")\n    )\n)\n\nNotes\n\nAll the arguments passed to a node are flattened into a single vector rather than preserving any nested structure. This means that passing two vectors of nodes to a div will result in a div node with a single vector of children (the concatenation of the two vectors) rather than two vector children. The only arguments that are not flattened are nested nodes.\n\nString arguments are automatically converted into text nodes. Text nodes do not have any children or attributes and when displayed the string is escaped using escapehtml.\n\nAttributes\n\nAs well as plain nodes shown in the previous example, nodes can have attributes added to them using the following syntax.\n\ndiv[\".my-class\"](\n    img[:src => \"foo.jpg\"],\n    input[\"#my-id\", :disabled]\n)\n\nIn the above example we add a class = \"my-class\" attribute to the div node, a src = \"foo.jpg\" to the img, and id = \"my-id\" disabled attributes to the input node.\n\nThe following syntax is supported within [...]:\n\ntag[\"#id\"]\ntag[\".class\"]\ntag[\".class#id\"]\ntag[:disabled]\ntag[:src => \"foo.jpg\"]\n# ... or any combination of the above arguments.\n\nInternal Representation\n\nThe @tags macro defines named Tag objects as follows\n\n@tags div p em strong\n\nexpands to\n\nconst div, p, em, strong = Tag(:div), Tag(:p), Tag(:em), Tag(:strong)\n\nThese Tag objects are lightweight representations of empty HTML elements without any attributes and cannot be used to represent a complete document. To create an actual tree of HTML elements that can be rendered we need to add some attributes and/or child elements using getindex or call syntax. Applying either to a Tag object will construct a new Node object.\n\ntag(...)      # No attributes.\ntag[...]      # No children.\ntag[...](...) # Has both attributes and children.\n\nAll three of the above syntaxes return a new Node object. Printing of Node objects is defined using the standard Julia display functions, so only needs a call to print to print out a valid HTML document with all nessesary text escaped.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.Utilities.DOM.HTMLDocument","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.Utilities.DOM.HTMLDocument","text":"A HTML node that wraps around the root node of the document and adds a DOCTYPE to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.Utilities.DOM.Node","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.Utilities.DOM.Node","text":"Represents an element within an HTML document including any textual content, children Nodes, and attributes.\n\nThis type should not be constructed directly, but instead via (...) and [...] applied to a Tag or another Node object.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.Utilities.DOM.Tag","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.Utilities.DOM.Tag","text":"Represents a empty and attribute-less HTML element.\n\nUse @tags to define instances of this type rather than manually creating them via Tag(:tagname).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.Utilities.DOM.escapehtml-Tuple{AbstractString}","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.Utilities.DOM.escapehtml","text":"Escape characters in the provided string.

This structure is preferred when publishing the generate HTML files as a website (e.g. on GitHub Pages), which is Documenter's primary use case.\n\nIf prettyurls = false, then Documenter generates src/foo.html instead, suitable for local documentation builds, as browsers do not normally resolve foo/ to foo/index.html for local files.\n\nTo have pretty URLs disabled in local builds, but still have them enabled for the automatic CI deployment builds, you can set prettyurls = get(ENV, \"CI\", nothing) == \"true\" (the specific environment variable you will need to check may depend on the CI system you are using, but this will work on Travis CI).\n\ndisable_git can be used to disable calls to git when the document is not in a Git-controlled repository. Without setting this to true, Documenter will throw an error and exit if any of the Git commands fail. The calls to Git are mainly used to gather information about the current commit hash and file paths, necessary for constructing the links to the remote repository.\n\nedit_link can be used to specify which branch, tag or commit (when passed a String) in the remote repository the edit buttons point to. If a special Symbol value :commit is passed, the current commit will be used instead. If set to nothing, the link edit link will be hidden altogether. By default, Documenter tries to determine it automatically by looking at the origin remote, and falls back to \"master\" if that fails.\n\nrepolink can be used to override the URL of the Git repository link in the top navbar (if passed a String). By default, Documenter attempts to determine the link from the Git remote of the repository (e.g. specified via the remote argument of makedocs). Passing a nothing disables the repository link.\n\ncanonical specifies the canonical URL for your documentation. We recommend you set this to the base url of your stable documentation, e.g. https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable. This allows search engines to know which version to send their users to. See wikipedia for more information. Default is nothing, in which case no canonical link is set.\n\nassets can be used to include additional assets (JS, CSS, ICO etc. files). See below for more information.\n\nanalytics can be used specify the Google Analytics tracking ID.\n\ncollapselevel controls the navigation level visible in the sidebar. Defaults to 2. To show fewer levels by default, set collapselevel = 1.\n\nsidebar_sitename determines whether the site name is shown in the sidebar or not. Setting it to false can be useful when the logo already contains the name of the package. Defaults to true.\n\nhighlights can be used to add highlighting for additional languages. By default, Documenter already highlights all the \"Common\" highlight.js languages and Julia (julia, julia-repl). Additional languages must be specified by their filenames as they appear on CDNJS for the highlight.js version Documenter is using. E.g. to include highlighting for YAML and LLVM IR, you would set highlights = [\"llvm\", \"yaml\"]. Note that no verification is done whether the provided language names are sane.\n\nmathengine specifies which LaTeX rendering engine will be used to render the math blocks. The options are either KaTeX (default), MathJax v2, or MathJax v3, enabled by passing an instance of KaTeX, MathJax2, or MathJax3 objects, respectively. The rendering engine can further be customized by passing options to the KaTeX or MathJax2/MathJax3 constructors.\n\nfooter can be a valid single-line markdown String or nothing and is displayed below the page navigation. Defaults to \"Powered by [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) and the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/).\".\n\nansicolor can be used to globally disable colored output from @repl and @example blocks by setting it to false (default: true).\n\nlang specifies the lang attribute of the top-level <html> element, declaring the language of the generated pages. The default value is \"en\".\n\nwarn_outdated inserts a warning if the current page is not the newest version of the documentation.\n\nExperimental options\n\nprerender a boolean (true or false (default)) for enabling prerendering/build time application of syntax highlighting of code blocks. Requires a node (NodeJS) executable to be available in PATH or to be passed as the node keyword.\n\nnode path to a node (NodeJS) executable used for prerendering.\n\nhighlightjs file path to custom highglight.js library to be used with prerendering.\n\nDefault and custom assets\n\nDocumenter copies all files under the source directory (e.g. /docs/src/) over to the compiled site. It also copies a set of default assets from /assets/html/ to the site's assets/ directory, unless the user already had a file with the same name, in which case the user's files overrides the Documenter's file. This could, in principle, be used for customizing the site's style and scripting.\n\nThe HTML output also links certain custom assets to the generated HTML documents, specifically a logo and additional javascript files. The asset files that should be linked must be placed in assets/, under the source directory (e.g /docs/src/assets) and must be on the top level (i.e. files in the subdirectories of assets/ are not linked).\n\nFor the logo, Documenter checks for the existence of assets/logo.{svg,png,webp,gif,jpg,jpeg}, in this order. The first one it finds gets displayed at the top of the navigation sidebar. It will also check for assets/logo-dark.{svg,png,webp,gif,jpg,jpeg} and use that for dark themes.\n\nAdditional JS, ICO, and CSS assets can be included in the generated pages by passing them as a list with the assets keyword. Each asset will be included in the <head> of every page in the order in which they are given. The type of the asset (i.e. whether it is going to be included with a <script> or a <link> tag) is determined by the file's extension – either .js, .ico[1], or .css (unless overridden with asset).\n\nSimple strings are assumed to be local assets and that each correspond to a file relative to the documentation source directory (conventionally src/). Non-local assets, identified by their absolute URLs, can be included with the asset function.\n\n[1]: Adding an ICO asset is primarily useful for setting a custom favicon.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.Writers.HTMLWriter.HTMLContext","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.Writers.HTMLWriter.HTMLContext","text":"HTMLWriter-specific globals that are passed to domify and other recursive functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/writers/#Documenter.Writers.HTMLWriter.KaTeX","page":"Writers","title":"Documenter.Writers.HTMLWriter.KaTeX","text":"KaTeX(config::Dict = <default>, override = false)\n\nAn instance of the KaTeX type can be passed to HTML via the mathengine keyword to specify that the KaTeX rendering engine should be used in the HTML output to render mathematical expressions.\n\nA dictionary can be passed via the config argument to configure KaTeX.

In most cases makedocs should be run from a make.jl file:\n\nusing Documenter\nmakedocs(\n    # keywords...\n)\n\nwhich is then run from the command line with:\n\n$ julia make.jl\n\nThe folder structure that makedocs expects looks like:\n\ndocs/\n    build/\n    src/\n    make.jl\n\nKeywords\n\nroot is the directory from which makedocs should run. When run from a make.jl file this keyword does not need to be set. It is, for the most part, needed when repeatedly running makedocs from the Julia REPL like so:\n\njulia> makedocs(root = joinpath(dirname(pathof(MyModule)), \"..\", \"docs\"))\n\nsource is the directory, relative to root, where the markdown source files are read from. By convention this folder is called src. Note that any non-markdown files stored in source are copied over to the build directory when makedocs is run.\n\nbuild is the directory, relative to root, into which generated files and folders are written when makedocs is run. The name of the build directory is, by convention, called build, though, like with source, users are free to change this to anything else to better suit their project needs.\n\nclean tells makedocs whether to remove all the content from the build folder prior to generating new content from source. By default this is set to true.\n\ndoctest instructs makedocs on whether to try to test Julia code blocks that are encountered in the generated document. By default this keyword is set to true. Doctesting should only ever be disabled when initially setting up a newly developed package where the developer is just trying to get their package and documentation structure correct. After that, it's encouraged to always make sure that documentation examples are runnable and produce the expected results. See the Doctests manual section for details about running doctests.\n\nSetting doctest to :only allows for doctesting without a full build. In this mode, most build stages are skipped and the strict keyword is ignored (a doctesting error will always make makedocs throw an error in this mode).\n\nmodules specifies a vector of modules that should be documented in source. If any inline docstrings from those modules are seen to be missing from the generated content then a warning will be printed during execution of makedocs. By default no modules are passed to modules and so no warnings will appear. This setting can be used as an indicator of the \"coverage\" of the generated documentation. For example Documenter's make.jl file contains:\n\nmakedocs(\n    modules = [Documenter],\n    # ...\n)\n\nand so any docstring from the module Documenter that is not spliced into the generated documentation in build will raise a warning.\n\nrepo specifies the browsable remote repository (e.g. on github.com). This is used for generating various remote links, such as the \"source\" links on docstrings. It can either be passed an object that implements the Remotes.Remote interface (e.g. Remotes.GitHub) or a template string. If a string is passed, it is interpreted according to the rules described in Remotes.URL.\n\nBy default, the repository is assumed to be hosted on GitHub, and the remote URL is determined by first checking the URL of the origin Git remote, and then falling back to checking the TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG (for Travis CI) and GITHUB_REPOSITORY (for GitHub Actions) environment variables. If this automatic procedure fails, a warning is printed.\n\nhighlightsig enables or disables automatic syntax highlighting of leading, unlabeled code blocks in docstrings (as Julia code). For example, if your docstring begins with an indented code block containing the function signature, then that block would be highlighted as if it were a labeled Julia code block. No other code blocks are affected. This feature is enabled by default.\n\nsitename is displayed in the title bar and/or the navigation menu when applicable.\n\nexpandfirst allows some of the pages to be expanded (i.e. at-blocks evaluated etc.) before the others. Documenter normally evaluates the files in the alphabetic order of their file paths relative to src, but expandfirst allows some pages to be prioritized.\n\nFor example, if you have foo.md and bar.md, bar.md would normally be evaluated before foo.md. But with expandfirst = [\"foo.md\"], you can force foo.md to be evaluated first.\n\nEvaluation order among the expandfirst pages is according to the order they appear in the argument.\n\ndraft can be set to true to build a draft version of the document. In draft mode some potentially time-consuming steps are skipped (e.g. running @example blocks), which is useful when iterating on the documentation. This setting can also be configured per-page by setting Draft = true in an @meta block.\n\nExperimental keywords\n\nIn addition to standard arguments there is a set of non-finalized experimental keyword arguments. The behaviour of these may change or they may be removed without deprecation when a minor version changes (i.e. except in patch releases).\n\ncheckdocs instructs makedocs to check whether all names within the modules defined in the modules keyword that have a docstring attached have the docstring also listed in the manual (e.g. there's a @docs block with that docstring). Possible values are :all (check all names; the default), :exports (check only exported names) and :none (no checks are performed). If strict=true (or strict=:missing_docs or strict=[:missing_docs, ...]) is also set then the build will fail if any missing docstrings are encountered.\n\nlinkcheck – if set to true makedocs uses curl to check the status codes of external-pointing links, to make sure that they are up-to-date. The links and their status codes are printed to the standard output. If strict is also set to true (or :linkcheck or a Vector including :linkcheck) then the build will fail if there are any broken (400+ status code) links. Default: false.\n\nlinkcheck_ignore allows certain URLs to be ignored in linkcheck. The values should be a list of strings (which get matched exactly) or Regex objects. By default nothing is ignored.\n\nlinkcheck_timeout configures how long curl waits (in seconds) for a link request to return a response before giving up. The default is 10 seconds.\n\nstrict – if set to true, makedocs fails the build right before rendering if it encountered any errors with the document in the previous build phases. The keyword strict can also be set to a Symbol or Vector{Symbol} to specify which kind of error (or errors) should be fatal. Options are: :autodocs_block, :cross_references, :docs_block, :doctest, :eval_block, :example_block, :footnote, :linkcheck, :meta_block, :missing_docs, :parse_error, and :setup_block. Use Documenter.except to explicitly set non-fatal errors.\n\nworkdir determines the working directory where @example and @repl code blocks are executed. It can be either a path or the special value :build (default).\n\nIf the workdir is set to a path, the working directory is reset to that path for each code block being evaluated. Relative paths are taken to be relative to root, but using absolute paths is recommended (e.g. workdir = joinpath(@__DIR__, \"..\") for executing in the package root for the usual docs/make.jl setup).\n\nWith the default :build option, the working directory is set to a subdirectory of build, determined from the source file path. E.g. for src/foo.md it is set to build/, for src/foo/bar.md it is set to build/foo etc.\n\nNote that workdir does not affect doctests.\n\nOutput formats\n\nformat allows the output format to be specified. The default format is Documenter.HTML which creates a set of HTML files, but Documenter also provides PDF output via the Documenter.LaTeX writer.\n\nOther formats can be enabled by using other addon-packages. For example, the DocumenterMarkdown package provides the original Markdown -> Markdown output. See the Other Output Formats for more information.\n\nSee Also\n\nA guide detailing how to document a package using Documenter's makedocs is provided in the setup guide in the manual.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/public/#Documenter.except","page":"Public","title":"Documenter.except","text":"Documenter.except(errors...)\n\nReturns the list of all valid error classes that can be passed as the strict argument to makedocs, except for the ones specified in the errors argument.

Note that any .gitignore files in the target directory affect which files will be committed to branch.\n\nRequired keyword arguments\n\nrepo is the remote repository where generated HTML content should be pushed to. Do not specify any protocol - \"https://\" or \"git@\" should not be present. This keyword must be set and will throw an error when left undefined. For example this package uses the following repo value:\n\nrepo = \"github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl.git\"\n\nOptional keyword arguments\n\ndeploy_config determines configuration for the deployment. If this is not specified Documenter will try to autodetect from the currently running environment. See the manual section about Deployment systems.\n\nroot has the same purpose as the root keyword for makedocs.\n\ntarget is the directory, relative to root, where generated content that should be deployed to gh-pages is written to. It should generally be the same as makedocs's build and defaults to \"build\".\n\nbranch is the branch where the generated documentation is pushed. If the branch does not exist, a new orphaned branch is created automatically. It defaults to \"gh-pages\".\n\ndirname is a subdirectory of branch that the docs should be added to. By default, it is \"\", which will add the docs to the root directory.\n\ndevbranch is the branch that \"tracks\" the in-development version of the generated documentation. By default Documenter tries to figure this out using git. Can be set explicitly as a string (typically \"master\" or \"main\").\n\ndevurl the folder that in-development version of the docs will be deployed. Defaults to \"dev\".\n\nforcepush a boolean that specifies the behavior of the git-deployment. The default (forcepush = false) is to push a new commit, but when forcepush = true the changes will be combined with the previous commit and force pushed, erasing the Git history on the deployment branch.\n\nversions determines content and order of the resulting version selector in the generated html. The following entries are valid in the versions vector:\n\n\"v#\": includes links to the latest documentation for each major release cycle (i.e. v2.0, v1.1).\n\"v#.#\": includes links to the latest documentation for each minor release cycle (i.e. v2.0, v1.1, v1.0, v0.1).\n\"v#.#.#\": includes links to all released versions.\n\"v^\": includes a link to the docs for the maximum version (i.e. a link vX.Y pointing to vX.Y.Z for highest X, Y, Z, respectively).\nA pair, e.g. \"first\" => \"second\", which will put \"first\" in the selector, and generate a url from which \"second\" can be accessed. The second argument can be \"v^\", to point to the maximum version docs (as in e.g. \"stable\" => \"v^\").\n\nIf versions = nothing documentation will be deployed directly to the \"root\", i.e. not to a versioned subfolder. See the manual section on Deploying without the versioning scheme for more details.\n\npush_preview a boolean that specifies if preview documentation should be deployed from pull requests or not. If your published documentation is hosted at \"https://USER.github.io/PACKAGE.jl/stable, by default the preview will be hosted at \"https://USER.github.io/PACKAGE.jl/previews/PR##\". This feature works for pull requests with head branch in the same repository, i.e. not from forks.\n\nbranch_previews is the branch to which pull request previews are deployed. It defaults to the value of branch.\n\nrepo_previews is the remote repository to which pull request previews are deployed. It defaults to the value of repo.\n\nnote: Note\nPull requests made from forks will not have previews. Hosting previews requires access to the deploy key. Therefore, previews are available only for pull requests that were submitted directly from the main repository.\n\ndeps can be set to a function or a callable object and gets called during deployment, and is usually used to install additional dependencies. By default, nothing gets executed.\n\nmake can be set to a function or a callable object and gets called during deployment, and is usually used to specify additional build steps. By default, nothing gets executed.\n\nReleases vs development branches\n\ndeploydocs will automatically figure out whether it is deploying the documentation for a tagged release or just a development branch (usually, based on the environment variables set by the CI system).\n\nWith versioned tags, deploydocs discards the build metadata (i.e. + and everything that follows it) from the version number when determining the name of the directory into which the documentation gets deployed. Pre-release identifiers are preserved.\n\nSee Also\n\nThe Hosting Documentation section of the manual provides a step-by-step guide to using the deploydocs function to automatically generate docs and push them to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/public/#Documenter.doctest","page":"Public","title":"Documenter.doctest","text":"doctest(package::Module; kwargs...)\n\nConvenience method that runs and checks all the doctests for a given Julia package. package must be the Module object corresponding to the top-level module of the package.

Setting manual = false will skip doctesting of manual pages altogether.\n\nAdditional keywords are passed on to the main doctest method.\n\n\n\n\n\ndoctest(source, modules; kwargs...)\n\nRuns all the doctests in the given modules and on manual pages under the source directory. Behaves like an @testset call, returning a testset if all the doctests are successful or throwing a TestSetException if there are any failures. Can be included in other testsets.\n\nThe manual pages are searched recursively in subdirectories of source too. Doctesting of manual pages can be disabled if source is set to nothing.\n\nKeywords\n\ntestset specifies the name of test testset (default Doctests).\n\ndoctestfilters vector of regex to filter tests (see the manual on Filtering Doctests)\n\nfix, if set to true, updates all the doctests that fail with the correct output (default false).\n\nwarning: Warning\nWhen running doctest(...; fix=true), Documenter will modify the Markdown and Julia source files. It is strongly recommended that you only run it on packages in Pkg's develop mode and commit any staged changes.

Currently it supports all the nodes necessary to represent Julia flavored Markdown. But having this as a separate module from the Markdown standard library allows us to consistently extend the node type we support (e.g. to support the raw HTML nodes from CommonMark, or strikethrough text from GitHub Flavored Markdown).\n\nMarkdown nodes split into to two different classes: block nodes and inline nodes. Generally, the direct children of a particular node can only be either inline or block (e.g. paragraphs contain inline nodes, admonitions contain block nodes as direct children).\n\nIn Markdown2, this is represented using a simple type hierarchy. All Markdown nodes are subtypes of either the MarkdownBlockNode or the MarkdownInlineNode abstract type. Both of these abstract types themselves are a subtype of the MarkdownNode.\n\nAdditional methods\n\nThe Base.convert(::Type{Markdown2.MD}, md::Markdown.MD) method can be used to convert the Julia Markdown standard libraries ASTs into Markdown2 ASTs.\nThe walk function can be used for walking over a Markdown2.MD tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"lib/internals/markdown2/#Documenter.Utilities.Markdown2.List","page":"Markdown2","title":"Documenter.Utilities.Markdown2.List","text":"struct List <: MarkdownBlockNode\n\nIf .orderedstart is nothing then the list is unordered.

For Git, this is a completely different tag, so it won't interfere with anything. But when Documenter runs on this tag, it will ignore the build metadata and deploy the docs as if they were for version v1.2.3.Note that, as with normal tag builds, you need to make sure that your CI that runs Documenter is configured to run on such tags (e.g. that the regex constraining the branches the CI runs on is broad enough etc).","category":"page"},{"location":"man/hosting/","page":"Hosting Documentation","title":"Hosting Documentation","text":"Once your documentation has been pushed to the gh-pages branch you should add links to your README.md pointing to the stable (and perhaps dev) documentation URLs.
