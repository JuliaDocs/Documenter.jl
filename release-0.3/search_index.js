This means than in the above example savefig will output the .svg files into that directory. This allows the images to be easily referenced without needing to worry about relative paths.@example blocks automatically define ans which, as in the Julia REPL, is bound to the value of the last evaluated expression. This can be useful in situations such as the following one where where binding the object returned by plot to a named variable would look out of place in the final rendered documentation:```@example\nusing Gadfly # hide\nplot([sin, x -> 2sin(x) + x], -2π, 2π)\ndraw(SVG(\"plot.svg\", 6inch, 4inch), ans); nothing # hide\n```\n\n![](plot.svg)"

The text before this line is the contents of the script which is run. The text that appears after # output is the textual representation that would be shown in the Julia REPL if the script had been included.The actual output produced by running the \"script\" is compared to the expected result and any difference will result in makedocs throwing an error and terminating.Note that the amount of whitespace appearing above and below the # output line is not significant and can be increased or decreased if desired."

When a code block contains one or more julia> at the start of a line then it is assumed to be a REPL doctest. Semi-colons, ;, at the end of a line works in the same way as in the Julia REPL and will suppress the output, although the line is still evaluated.Note that not all features of the REPL are supported such as shell and help modes."

These tagged directories are persistent and must be manually removed from the gh-pages branch if necessary.Once your documentation has been pushed to the gh-pages branch you should add links to your README.md pointing to the stable and latest documentation URLs. It is common practice to make use of \"badges\" similar to those used for Travis and AppVeyor build statuses or code coverage. Adding the following to your package README.md should be all that is necessary:[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-stable-blue.svg)](https://USER_NAME.github.io/PACKAGE_NAME.jl/stable)\n[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-blue.svg)](https://USER_NAME.github.io/PACKAGE_NAME.jl/latest)PACKAGE_NAME and USER_NAME should be replaced with their appropriate values. The colour and text of the image can be changed by altering docs-stable-blue as described on shields.io, though it is recommended that package authors follow this standard to make it easier for potential users to find documentation links across multiple package README files.Final RemarksThat should be all that is needed to enable automatic documentation building. Pushing new commits to your master branch should trigger doc builds. Note that other branches do not trigger these builds and neither do pull requests by potential contributors.If you would like to see a more complete example of how this process is setup then take a look at this package's repository for some inspiration."

The name of the build directory is, by convention, called build, though, like with source, users are free to change this to anything else to better suit their project needs.\n\nclean tells makedocs whether to remove all the content from the build folder prior to generating new content from source. By default this is set to true.\n\ndoctest instructs makedocs on whether to try to test Julia code blocks that are encountered in the generated document. By default this keyword is set to true. Doctesting should only ever be disabled when initially setting up a newly developed package where the developer is just trying to get their package and documentation structure correct. After that, it's encouraged to always make sure that documentation examples are runnable and produce the expected results. See the Doctests manual section for details about running doctests.\n\nmodules specifies a vector of modules that should be documented in source. If any inline docstrings from those modules are seen to be missing from the generated content then a warning will be printed during execution of makedocs. By default no modules are passed to modules and so no warnings will appear. This setting can be used as an indicator of the \"coverage\" of the generated documentation. For example Documenter's make.jl file contains:\n\nmakedocs(\n    modules = [Documenter],\n    # ...\n)\n\nand so any docstring from the module Documenter that is not spliced into the generated documentation in build will raise a warning.\n\nrepo specifies a template for the \"link to source\" feature. If you are using GitHub, this is automatically generated from the remote. If you are using a different host, you can use this option to tell Documenter how URLs should be generated. The following placeholders will be replaced with the respective value of the generated link:\n\n{commit} Git commit id\n{path} Path to the file in the repository\n{line} Line (or range of lines) in the source file\n\nFor example if you are using GitLab.com, you could use\n\nmakedocs(repo = \"https://gitlab.com/user/project/blob/{commit}{path}#L{line}\")\n\nSee Also\n\nA guide detailing how to document a package using Documenter's makedocs is provided in the Usage section of the manual.\n\n\n\n"

Define the ones we actually need.\n@tags div p em strong ul li\n\ndiv(\n    p(\"This \", em(\"is\"), \" a \", strong(\"paragraph.\"),\n    p(\"And this is \", strong(\"another\"), \" one\"),\n    ul(\n        li(\"and\"),\n        li(\"an\"),\n        li(\"unordered\"),\n        li(\"list\")\n    )\n)\n\nNotes\n\nAll the arguments passed to a node are flattened into a single vector rather than preserving any nested structure. This means that passing two vectors of nodes to a div will result in a div node with a single vector of children (the concatenation of the two vectors) rather than two vector children. The only arguments that are not flattened are nested nodes.\n\nString arguments are automatically converted into text nodes. Text nodes do not have any children or attributes and when displayed the string is escaped using escapehtml.\n\nAttributes\n\nAs well as plain nodes shown in the previous example, nodes can have attributes added to them using the following syntax.\n\ndiv[\".my-class\"](\n    img[:src => \"foo.jpg\"],\n    input[\"#my-id\", :disabled]\n)\n\nIn the above example we add a class = \"my-class\" attribute to the div node, a src = \"foo.jpg\" to the img, and id = \"my-id\" disabled attributes to the input node.\n\nThe following syntax is supported within [...]:\n\ntag[\"#id\"]\ntag[\".class\"]\ntag[\".class#id\"]\ntag[:disabled]\ntag[:src => \"foo.jpg\"]\n# ... or any combination of the above arguments.\n\nInternal Representation\n\nThe @tags macro defines named Tag objects as follows\n\n@tags div p em strong\n\nexpands to\n\nconst div, p, em, strong = Tag(:div), Tag(:p), Tag(:em), Tag(:strong)\n\nThese Tag objects are lightweight representations of empty HTML elements without any attributes and cannot be used to represent a complete document. To create an actual tree of HTML elements that can be rendered we need to add some attributes and/or child elements using getindex or call syntax. Applying either to a Tag object will construct a new Node object.\n\ntag(...)      # No attributes.\ntag[...]      # No children.\ntag[...](...) # Has both attributes and children.\n\nAll three of the above syntaxes return a new Node object. Printing of Node objects is defined using the standard Julia display functions, so only needs a call to print to print out a valid HTML document with all nessesary text escaped.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Provides the render methods to write the documentation as HTML files (MIME\"text/html\").\n\nPage outline\n\nThe HTMLWriter makes use of the page outline that is determined by the headings. It is assumed that if the very first block of a page is a level 1 heading, then it is intended as the page title. This has two consequences:\n\nIt is then used to automatically determine the page title in the navigation menu and in the <title> tag, unless specified in the .pages option.\nIf the first heading is interpreted as being the page title, it is not displayed in the navigation sidebar.\n\nDefault and custom assets\n\nDocumenter copies all files under the source directory (e.g. /docs/src/) over to the compiled site. It also copies a set of default assets from /assets/html/ to the site's assets/ directory, unless the user already had a file with the same name, in which case the user's files overrides the Documenter's file. This could, in principle, be used for customizing the site's style and scripting.\n\nThe HTML output also links certain custom assets to the generated HTML documents, specfically a logo and additional javascript files. The asset files that should be linked must be placed in assets/, under the source directory (e.g /docs/src/assets) and must be on the top level (i.e. files in the subdirectories of assets/ are not linked).\n\nFor the logo, Documenter checks for the existence of assets/logo.png. If that's present, it gets displayed in the navigation bar.\n\nFor scripts, every assets/*.js gets a <script> link in the <head> tag of every page (except if it matches one of Documenter's default scripts; the filtering is done in user_scripts).\n\nNote that only javascript files are linked to the generated HTML. Any related CSS must be loaded by the script. With jQuery this could be done with the following snippet\n\n$('head').append($('<link rel=\"stylesheet\">').attr('href', documenterBaseURL + \"/assets/<file>.css\"))\n\n\n\n"
